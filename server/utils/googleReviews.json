      "text": "*Hotel Security Issues*\n\nI am highly doubtful about the security level of this hotel which does not live up to my expectation of a five-star hotel.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my colleagues and I worked in the ballroom for photography and videography. His equipment, including the expensive lenses, were stolen. He spotted the thief and chased after him but in vain. He reported this to the hotel staff, but to his appointment, the hotel did not assist and it appeared to us that they did not care. We were not sure if this hotel venue has been a popular place for stealing. It was the indifference and no offer of help that concern me the most. Maybe this hotel is a hot spot for event thefts.\n\nImagine you are an event participant, there is a high chance that your personal belongings could be stolen but the hotel just would not care; imagine you are an event organizer, or an exhibitor, your assets will be at high risks as it is likely that event thieves may target you and your valuables as they knew there would be no consequences.\n\nThink twice if you are considering booking this venue for business or a personal vacation. I have lost my trust in them. I hope you don’t need to go through the loss or disappointment like we did.",

They provided all the necessary information about the hotel's facilities and services.\n\nThe room itself was comfortable and well-appointed. It was clean, and the bed was cozy, which made for a restful night's sleep. The soundproofing was effective, considering the proximity to the airport, as I wasn't disturbed by any noise from outside.\n\nI also appreciated the in-room amenities, including a coffee maker and a well-stocked bathroom with toiletries. These little touches made the stay even more comfortable.\n\nFor dinner, I dined at the hotel's restaurant and was pleased with the quality of the food and the variety of options available. The breakfast buffet offered a good selection, ensuring a hearty start to the day.\n\nThe hotel's shuttle service to and from the airport was punctual and convenient, making it easy to catch my flight without any stress.\n\nOverall, my one-night was exactly what I needed for a seamless stopover near to the location.The combination of comfort, convenience, and friendly service made it a great choice, especially for travelers with tight schedules. I would definitely consider staying here again in the future.",

      "text": "I would avoid this hotel at all costs, it is not safe and they do have adequate security. This is a scathing review, but I'm sure if you continue to read this review you will understand why. As a professional subcontractor employed to work at this hotel, while working at this hotel at a conference we had our equipment stolen, which totalled thousands of pounds.\nThe equipment was stolen from the actual conference room which was fully occupied at the time, and the conference was running. The thief made their way unchallenged into the hotel, pretending to be a delegate attending the conference and walked straight into the conference room during the conference and stole the equipment and walked out without being challenged by hotel security. The hotel security is completely lethargic and asleep on duty. They haven't been at all helpful with this incident, and were reluctant to even contact the police, the hotel is completely responsible and they failed in their duties to provide adequate security for the event. I am confident more thefts happened that day, but have gone unreported. We even asked for a safe place for storage of our bags/equipment and the hotel said they have good security and the room the conference was taking place was safe...\nThe conference attendees all had lanyards, but the hotel failed to provide adequate security to check and challenge appropriately like other hotels do.\nMy advice would be to find another hotel to hold your conference or meeting, be warned this hotel will ruin your conference or meeting as they have a dated approach to security, and how to protect their clients and customers. This is the sort of place where anything could happen as the staff are not doing what they should be. Overall, in my opinion the minimum wage staff are doing the minimum basics...\nPoor management of what would be a great hotel, in a premium location.",

I stayed at the hotel for couple of nights in March and my coat was stolen when stored by the concierge in the hotel cloak room. The reception staff gave me an email address to send a claim which happened to be the wrong one. After at least 5 emails and couple of calls I have finally been given the email of the person in charge of the claims, the Director of Risk & Compliance. I have emailed this gentleman who did not reply. I have then called him few times and he was always very nice on the phone asking me to send an email again and he mentioned he would personally manage the claim process. However, he never replied to any of my emails. After over 6 months I have not even been able to get a response from the hotel. Although a bit disappointing to get my personal belongings stolen while kept by the hotel security team, I can understand. However, not even be able to provide a response to my very courteous request despite many attempts is definitely not acceptable, especially for a hotel advertised as \"premium\". This hotel may have gotten its stars thanks to the nice location, but definitely not  to its customer service. Definitely not recommend. Benjamin (Canada).",

You gotta love them 😊\n\nThe valets are also VERY helpful and pleasant .\n\nOverall the hotel asks for way more than it deserves nor provide its guests.\n\nOnly come here if you want easy access to the Kensington park, otherwise there are much better options near by.",

From the moment I stepped foot into the premises, it became evident that this establishment lacks the fundamental principles of hospitality and integrity.\n\nThe staff at the Royal Garden Hotel could not have been more discourteous and unhelpful if they had tried. It was as though they had been trained to avoid eye contact and ignore guest requests. Simple queries were met with dismissive shrugs and sighs, leaving me feeling like an unwanted burden rather than a paying guest. The lack of basic manners and a complete disregard for customer service was truly disheartening.\n\nAs if the dreadful staff attitude wasn't enough, the issue of theft within the hotel was deeply concerning. It became apparent that security and guest safety were not a priority for the Royal Garden Hotel. Valuables mysteriously vanished from my room, and when I reported the incident to the front desk, I was met with indifference and skepticism. It was evident that the staff had no intention of taking responsibility or even attempting to investigate the matter.\n\nThe feeling of violation and insecurity caused by these theft incidents completely overshadowed any semblance of comfort the hotel might have provided. Trust is the cornerstone of any accommodation, and the Royal Garden Hotel's blatant disregard for the safety of its guests shattered that trust into a million pieces.\n\nIt's truly disheartening to witness such a prestigious-looking establishment fall so short of its promises. The negative experience I encountered at the Royal Garden Hotel is not one I would wish upon anyone. Until the management addresses the deplorable staff attitude and takes concrete measures to ensure the safety and security of their guests, I strongly advise travelers to steer clear of this establishment. There are countless other hotels that prioritize their guests' well-being and offer genuine hospitality, making the Royal Garden Hotel a regrettable choice for anyone seeking a pleasant and secure stay.\n\nتجربة مخيبة في فندق رويال جاردن: سلوك العاملين وحوادث السرقة\n\nالتقييم: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)\n\nإقامتي الأخيرة في فندق رويال جاردن كانت تجربة مخيبة للآمال بسبب سوء سلوك الموظفين وحوادث السرقة المثيرة للقلق. منذ لحظة أن وضعت قدمي في المكان، أصبح واضحًا أن هذا المكان يفتقر إلى مبادئ الضيافة والنزاهة الأساسية.\n\nلم يكن الموظفون في فندق رويال جاردن يمكن أن يكونوا أكثر تكبرًا وعدم مساعدة إذا ما حاولوا. كان الأمر وكأنهم تم تدريبهم على تجنب ملامسة العيون وتجاهل طلبات النزلاء. تلقت استفسارات بسيطة نظرات تجاهل وتنهيدات، مما جعلني أشعر كأنني عبء غير مرغوب فيه بدلاً من نزيل مدفوع الأجر. نقص الأخلاقيات البسيطة والاستهتار الكامل بخدمة العملاء كان حقًا محبطًا.\n\nكما لو كان سوء سلوك الموظفين غير كافٍ، فإن مسألة السرقة داخل الفندق كانت مثيرة للقلق بشدة. أصبح واضحًا أن الأمان وسلامة النزلاء ليستا أولوية لفندق رويال جاردن. اختفت الأشياء الثمينة بشكل غامض من غرفتي، وعندما أبلغت الاستقبال بالحادث، واجهت تجاهلًا وشكوكًا. كان من الواضح أن الموظفين لم يكونوا لديهم نية لتحمل المسؤولية أو حتى محاولة التحقيق في المسألة.\n\nالشعور بالانتهاك وعدم الأمان الذي تسببت فيه حوادث السرقة هذه قام بتحطيم أي طمأنينة قد يكون قدمها الفندق. الثقة هي ركيزة أي إقامة، واستهانة فندق رويال جاردن بسلامة نزلائه أدت إلى تفتيت تلك الثقة إلى مليون قطعة.\n\nمن المؤلم حقًا رؤية مؤسسة بمظهر مرموق تفشل لهذا الحد في وعودها. التجربة السلبية التي واجهتها في فندق رويال جاردن ليست تجربة أتمناها لأي شخص. حتى يتعامل الإدارة مع سلوك الموظفين المذموم ويتخذ إجراءات ملموسة لضمان سلامة وأمان ضيوفها، أنصح بشدة المسافرين بتجنب هذا المكان. هناك العديد من الفنادق الأخرى التي تولي أولوية لراحة ضيوفها وتقدم ضيافة حقيقية، مما يجعل فندق رويال جاردن خيارًا مأساويًا لمن يبحثون عن إقامة ممتعة وآمنة",

We were given a first floor room right on top of the entrance awning, full of pigeons.\nUpon complaining, we were very politely told: 1) that we should be glad to get a room in the renovation part of the hotel; 2) that we shouldn’t have used third party agents to  book a room.\nThe lobby of the hotel is full of luggages on hold, which projects a rather untidy impression as soon as you enter.\nOur breakfast, of acceptable quality and nice park view, was included, yet the hostess tried a few time to have us sign a paper agreeing to pay for a “discretionary service charge”. I refused to sign.\nThe room has no safe deposit.\nElevators are always packed.\nWhat a disappointment.",

      "text": "Had a mixed experience here. The Royal Garden is a 5-star hotel and my review is based on that. The pros: location is good. You’re right on High Street and literally next door to Kensington Gardens. Our room had a really nice view of the city but you can pay extra for a Garden view. The hotel is also a short walk (10 minutes) to Portabella Market. The bell-staff are good and helped with bags in and out. There’s a piano bar in the restaurant which was fun to sit in at the end of the night and hear some cover songs. Nothing exceptional but a fun perk.\n\nNow for the not-so-good. The room despite its high price was very small and didn’t even have room to put a standard luggage suitcase. My wife had to put hers on the floor next to the bed and mine went on the only seat in the room. I think they could have laid the rooms out better. I would have preferred a less “fancy” hotel with a little larger room. On our trip it was the only Hotel I felt cramped and we both kept tripping on our stuff because it was so small.\n\nThis is also the first hi-end hotel I’ve stayed in that didn’t have an iron or steamer in room. And when I called to the front desk “all the irons are not available, and we don’t have steamers.” So I had to wear a wrinkly shirt to a nice dinner. Should be pretty easy to order a few extra irons, and to me that’s inexcusable at a 5-star spot.\n\nThe rooms are the worst sound proofing out of any hotel we stayed in our trip. We could literally hear the people in the next room talking, making noises, etc all night. The hallways each day were also littered with trash. I’m not sure if the hotel doesn’t monitor the hallways or there were just really messy people on our floor, but it smelled terrible and was nasty to look at peoples garbage all over the halls in a “5-star hotel”…every day of our 4-day stay.\n\nNext, the staff members from concierge to front desk to bell-man were clueless about their location. We checked in late and I asked each of them if there was any food around the area. “Oh no it’s past 10pm”….”Not in London ha!”….”maybe an American diner about 30 minutes away”…Mind you it’s Saturday night. Well we walked out the hotel went one block west (2 minute walk) and found an awesome food market with everything from brick oven pizza to Thai food… And actually had one of our best dinners in London there! On top of that we went back to the hotel to the piano bar and guess what: yup the piano bar serves pizzas and snacks til 12am. No one in the entire hotel even knew about their own restaurant. Yes: We asked both the concierge and the front desk and neither knew. Again for a 5-star, not acceptable.\n\nAnd probably the thing that really left a bad taste in our mouths was how the staff treated us. We had extended our room on our 2nd night with the front desk to add a 4th night. And then on our 4th day when the extension was to happen, our keys stopped working. We went to the front desk assuming they simply forgot to fix the keys, but when we arrived they told us they had a “priority customer who stays there all the time who needs the room”…so basically they were ready to kick us out for a more “fancy” person. And they had no rooms left. Seriously?! A 5-star hotel does this? It’s not a bad hotel but it’s not a good one either. I wouldn’t stay here again especially considering the price. I don’t feel there was anything 5-star about the experience.",

Stock, tolle Aussicht auf den Park, Bad mit Dusche/Wanne/WC + extra WC, perfekt für 4 Pers., allerdings haben wir sehr eine Klobürste vermisst!! Ich weiß, dass das in höherpreisigen Hotels in London üblich ist, dass es keine gibt, aber gerade wenn man zu viert ist, kann das schnell unangenehm werden! Große Fenster, helles freundliches Zimmer mit räumlicher Abtrennung zur Schlafcouch. 2 TV. Sogar 2 deutsche Kanäle empfangbar. Personal durchweg freundlich und hilfsbereit. Nette PianoBar mit Livemusik während unseres Aufenthalts. Frühstück und Restaurant, sowie Fitness Center und Spa können wir nicht bewerten, da nicht genutzt. Sehr viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, Cafés und Restaurants fußläufig (Für Selbstversorger: Marks&Spencer Foodhall ist günstiger als der WholeFoodMarket ;-) ). Bushaltestelle direkt vor der Tür. U-Bahn 3-4min. zu Fuß. Dadurch grandiose Anbindung zum/vom Flughafen und ins Touristenzentrum (Bus Linie 9, wir empfehlen unbedingt die OysterCard zu kaufen!). Hyde Park unmittelbar angrenzend. Holland Park 10min zu Fuß. Fazit: super Standort für einen Städtetrip.",

Surprisingly large room on the 5th floor, great view of the park, bathroom with shower/tub/toilet + extra toilet, perfect for 4 people, but we really missed a toilet brush!! I know it's common in higher priced hotels in London that there aren't any, but especially when there are four of you it can quickly become uncomfortable! Large windows, bright, friendly room with spatial separation from the sofa bed. 2 TVs. Even 2 German channels can be received. Staff consistently friendly and helpful. Nice piano bar with live music during our stay. We can't rate breakfast and restaurant, as well as fitness center and spa, since we didn't use them. Lots of shopping, cafés and restaurants within walking distance (for self-catering: Marks&Spencer Foodhall is cheaper than the WholeFoodMarket ;-) ). Bus stop right in front of the door. Subway 3-4min. on foot. This means great connections to/from the airport and the tourist center (bus line 9, we definitely recommend buying the OysterCard!). Hyde Park immediately adjacent. Holland Park 10 mins walk. Conclusion: great location for a city trip.",

Even before our stay, I called the concierge, (Adan) last minute to arrange for a car service to pick us up at the airport.  Our flight was delayed and we arrived late in the evening but our driver was there waiting for us at the airport and drove us safely to the hotel in about half hour.  The staff were extremely professional and friendly.  Adan and Vivian at the front desk greeted and welcomed us immediately.  We got to the hotel very late and we were hungry so we ordered room service which hit the spot.   We rented the Royal Deluxe suite and were given a nice room, spacious with a king-size bed and sofa bed.  There's a big bathroom that included a shower and separate bathtub.  We had a great view of the park and Kensington Palace.  Breakfast was included with our room.  We took full advantage of it everyday and we were very satisfied. For dinner, we tried Min Jiang and Origin restaurant another night.  We enjoyed both restaurants but management at Origin restaurant went above and beyond.  Mauricio, and our waiter, Howard, took great care of us.  They were very attentive and the food was good too.   The breakfast staff were great as well.  Can't name them all but Alberto was one of the waiters who we felt did a great job.   Other notable names to mention are Ken, Naz, Marlon, Najir, Aimee, and Carlos.  Thank you all for everything and for being so pleasant.  Also can't forget the housekeeping staff who prepared our room and stocked everything we needed everyday.  Overall, service was great, location was perfect and we had a wonderful time. We would absolutely book this hotel again in the future.  Thank you.",

We decided not to complain, because we figured everything would be fine. The room had no safe, and as an international traveler, the security of having a safe is pretty important. Again, we decided to say nothing. My third and final strike, was ordering food to our hotel and having Eddie, the rudest concierge I’ve ever encountered, throw our food away while we were on our way back to the hotel after a night out, after berating us. His tone was truly the lowest of lows and he made me uncomfortable to continue staying at the hotel. Eddie told us he didn’t think we’d like it and proceeded to throw away £42 of food. I spoke to two managers, who told me I would be emailed about this incident, never followed up. As someone who has stayed here before, I promise you it will never happen again. The way Eddie spoke to us, treated us, and then the way they handled the situation was the deciding factor in never staying here again. The service is astonishingly terrible and I was horribly disappointed.",

Every time I call the office, the manager is supposedly busy, or not in office.

So I had a terrible nights sleep and for £389 I feel pretty unimpressed with this.\n\nI also asked the staff for an iron and ironing board three times despite telling them I needed it urgently when I checked in.\n\nWhen I got to my room there was someone from maintenance fixing a broken cupboard door. I wasn’t told anyone would be in my room. I waited ten minutes and he left after being unsuccessful in his attempt.\n\nAll in all the hotel lacked any sort of wow factor.\n\nI won’t be staying here again.",

From the moment I walked in, I was struck by the stylish decor and the welcoming atmosphere. The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, and made me feel right at home.\n\nThe room itself was spacious. The bed was comfortable, the linens were soft and of high quality, and the bathroom was immaculate. But the real highlight of my stay was the rooftop . Overlooking the city of London, I felt like I was on top of the world. The view was truly breathtaking, and I spent hours just gazing out at the incredible skyline.\n\nThe hotel’s rooftop bar was the perfect spot to relax and enjoy a drink after a long day of exploring. And speaking of exploring, the hotel is located in the heart of Shoreditch, one of London's most vibrant neighborhoods. There is so much to see and do in the area, from trendy restaurants and bars to vintage shops and art galleries.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Courthouse Shoreditch Hotel was nothing short of amazing. The staff especially Andres the concierge, and the location all exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable stay in London.",

We attended on Sunday 29th January.\nPositives:\nOur voucher had expired due to Covid lockdowns and illness, and the restaurant manager still allowed us to use it.\nNegatives:\nThe waitress didn't write down our order and didn't seem attentive. We repeated it twice and she still came back to check. This meant our order of cheeseburger with no salad or mayonnaise came with salad and lots of mayonnaise. We sent it back and said no mayonnaise. It then came back still with salad, no mayonnaise but also no cheese. We asked for cheese to be put on but the waiter who brought it indicated the kitchen was soon to close and wouldn't do it. We then went to the cinema portion of our deal. The show started late and kept freezing with a red screen. Everyone sat for 45 minutes with no communication from staff. When I eventually went to the projection room window and questioned what was happening someone finally came out and apologised and said there were technical difficulties; yes we know, we realised this 45 minutes ago! We were offered a free drink and I was told to use the email from my booking to rebook for another time. I don’t think I will, as the service was so bad and the film I wanted to see will not be on anyway.",

This close to Christmas everything else nearby was fully booked or extremely expensive. They said the only thing they could offer is a room in Kensington (about an hour away from the venue we were at!). They claimed the other hotel was nice but in reality it felt a lot more like a crummy 3-star hotel...\n\nI get that mistakes sometimes happen but they didn't really seem to care that much and they were doing this all so last minute. Also they didn't offer any kind of discount on what we were meant to pay. Especially annoying since we had to book new train tickets for the next day since it was nowhere near Liverpool Street.\n\nOverall just bad management / poor quality.",

On arrival there was no door man which isn't a criticism but there are steep stairs up to the hotel which some people may find difficult. Once inside there where 3 porters all just standing about chatting not one of them offered to help us they just pointed about reception and carried on with their conversation. The receptionist was slouched behind the desk looking rather crumpled, to be honest I wasn't sure he was the receptionist, however he was pleasant and checked us in, BUT, and this was a big but, he refused to give us our keys until we had agreed to have a £50 charge against out credit cards in case of damage to the room. I have never been asked for this before, especially in an establishment which is supposedly 4 stars. If he had said it was for any extras charged to the room then maybe but he was very clear it was for any damages we incurred. The room it's self was spotlessly clean and very spacious.  On the whole it was ok but not worth the money we paid.",

As half an hour past and no body has come to us we went out to the reception and asked the man what was going on, why the delay, he again asked as to wait and told us to wait in the same room, that was empty. We asked for the manager and a man called Richard came to tell us they had an emergency in the kitchen and there was no service, he asked us to reschedule and offered us cinema tickets, we declined this. The expirience was really bad given we were celebrating my Bday and had tickets to go to an exhibition after, so we were hungry and with not time to look for something else. Why did they leave us there waiting in an empty dinning room for so long?  Why didn't they tell us when we phoned on our way there? Why didn't tell us when we arrived?  How long would we have stayed there if we didn't asked? Really bad, not a good expirience.",

Some bathroom fixtures were loose, and a light bulb was blinking - however this really did not impede on our stay in a noticeable way.  Also, the rooms were very quiet - which is surprising due to the nightlife available in the area as well as constant traffic flow. The reception staff were always helpful and had great recommendations. Breakfast was really good providing a large range of buffet options, and staff were on hand and there to help or keep supply refreshed. The Bar area was beautifully decorated, and staff would come in to serve you if and when required - great cocktails! The location is excellent for access to food, entertainment, transport and airports. Overall, very happy with our stay and would highly recommend staying here.",

      "text": "We booked a voucher for bottomless brunch + cinema at Courthouse Hotel Shoreditch via BuyAGift and it was the worst ‘voucher experiences’ I have ever had in my life.\n\nWe arrived 10 minutes early and the receptionist sent us to the rooftop bar. At the bar they didn’t know why we were there and after some commotion we were escorted back down to another bar elsewhere in the hotel, asked to take a seat and told that someone would come and take care of us. We waited for 15 minutes and no one arrived.\n\nAfter it was clear we had been abandoned, I got up to talk to the waiter and was told that the movie was starting and we should go to the cinema right away. I asked about our brunch and prosecco. He said to ask about it after the movie, since otherwise we would miss it. I was quite concerned about this since we were quite hungry and thirsty at this point but we duly went down to the cinema and sat through the movie.\n\nAfter the movie we were very hungry and looking forward to our food and drink. Again we talked to the receptionist and were told to go to the rooftop bar. We talked with the bartender, saying we were there for our brunch and prosecco. Unfortunately, we were told the chef had gone home and it was not possible to get any food. We were told we could still have a drink but at this point it was clear that the experience was irrecoverable and as we were very hungry we left.\n\nWe travelled an hour each way for this experience and it was extremely disappointing. We have attempted to get a refund but our emails have been ignored. Buyer beware.",

However, when I told the receptionist this, I was interrupted by the hotel manager in a rude manner. He did not want to collaborate and was telling me it was my problem.\nEventually, I manage to do the check-in, but when I arrived at my room the hot water handler from the shower was missing and the water was boiling hot. I informed the hotel manager and he said they were going to send maintenance to my room. The next day I left for work and when I arrived back at the hotel the hot water handler was still missing and my room hadn't been clean. So neither maintenance nor cleaning staff went to my room.",

But on leaving we were presented by a large bill from the waiter, we had a paid voucher which we gave to the front of house on arrival how really embarrassing for us in front of other guest we felt so small ! The restaurant manager quickly resolved the problem and apologised, but unfortunately spoiled the afternoon we were looking so forward to.",

What wasn't clear that was that it included extra servings of things that you may have particularly liked.  We did have a couple of extras but it wasn't clear that they would cost more money or not (they didn't).\n\nOn first arrival the piano was a bit loud, but when the room filled up the sound was absorbed more.\n\nThe total bill was £184 as service charge is added to the £80.   By any objective logic this is a somewhat crazy price for a few sandwiches and a few cakes.   But as an experience and it should be emphasised that experience counts for a great deal, then this should be considered as a great afternoon.",

The Cote de boeff is amazing and the rum baba dessert will be flambéed at your table.\n\nThe American bar is indulgent and expensive, just why people go there!\n\nUpdate. The River Restaurant is absolutely lovely. Friendly service and great food!",

      "text": "My husband and I spent 5 days here after several days being on a countryside road trip … from the first point of contact to the very last second.. we were so impressed with the level of service that was bestowed on us .. as well as all guests I am sure❤️ I would always make it a point to note staffs’ name when they gave me great services BUT HERE you cannot do that because the review will be filled with so many names.. every employee greets you and showed enthusiasm when in engagement! I was over the moon impressed with Ibrahim who upon noticing that my lighter went out of gas gifted me with his very own lighter😍 in between him attending to guests going up to the restaurants .. we enjoyed a delightful conversation.\nOur room was magnificent,, the VIEW ALL AROUND including the bathroom .. OUT OF THIS WORLD MAGNIFICENT! This is the first hotel that we are asked when we would prefer to have our room cleaned .. WOW😍 there is a form you fill up to indicate your preferences on almost about anything associated with your room .. the human comfort factor was indeed a much thought process .. the heated toilet seats etc etc … there’s always fresh cookies or cakes in the room.. little things that matters really go a long way\nLocation is PERFECT … whatever mode of transportation, private or public… ITS HERE!!! So easy … LOVE LOVE LOVE and thank you for making our stay as one of our BEST EVER EXPERIENCE❤️  Oh! THE BINOCULARS IS AWESOME❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",

Every request was met with a smile and prompt service. The attention to detail is impressive, making you feel like a VIP throughout your stay.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, elegantly designed, and equipped with all the modern amenities you could wish for. The comfortable beds provided a peaceful night's sleep, and the marble-clad bathrooms were a treat.\n\nThe hotel's location is also perfect for exploring London. You're within walking distance of many attractions and have easy access to public transportation.\n\nIn summary, Shangri-La The Shard is a true gem in London's hospitality scene. The combination of impeccable service, stunning views, and luxurious accommodations make it a 5-star experience that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting this Hotel.",

Simply wow, and had amazing staff who were genuinely attentive and wonderful. You could spent a week here and never get bored, even the rooms had binoculars to enjoy the incredible views.\n\nConstructive criticism wise… the rooms obviously have amazing views, and we’re alright in terms of upkeep but you can tell it’s reaching over 10 years old. Guest services were not very responsive in the lead up to the stay, and there were a few issues during our stay, such as getting calls stating the do not disturb was on, so no cleaning would be done, when the DND wasn’t switched on, and small fixture issues. However, reception addressed these upon check out, and did not make a fuss when we removed the 5% room cleaning fee applied each day.",

We were supposed to go to Gong as we wanted to enjoy the views, but due to an unforeseen circumstance we were not able to go up. We had to discuss with the staff who were very stringent and not welcoming. We waited in the lobby for far too long until we went to their restaurant called \"Ting\" as a result. Honestly, did not have a good experience here. Yes the view was wonderful, but the feeling being there was not the greatest. There was nobody serving us for at least a solid 12 minutes. We waited a long time to simply get water. The drinks we had were not to the high-level we were expecting and ordinarily experience at the Shangri-La. We ordered some glasses of wine and the waiter seemed very inexperienced. He did not know of the wines we wanted and we had to point out the specific ones on the menu. We visit this hotel in many countries and this one particularly did not live up to the Shangri-La experience. It was surprising because we expected that in London of all places, this hotel would be of high calibre. My family is not happy about this experience.",

Our two young kids also loved the pool, which has the kids hours, and my husband enjoyed the nice sauna at the hotel.  On top of that, the location is super convenient as it is right next to the train station and also a short walking distance to the Borough Market, where we visit almost every day.  We hope to be back there soon!",

      "text": "On the 1st of May, I checked into the hotel for 2 nights with my 2yo and 8 months old. At 21:15 someone, who clearly was a member of the staff as they had a key, entered my room without knocking. Not only was I in my underwear but my 8 months old baby was sleeping in her cot which was directly in front of the door. The door slammed against her bed as this individu walked in, waking up my baby screaming which I took an hour and a half putting to sleep. Being by myself with 2 under 3, the whole scenario was very disturbing.\n\nThis was unacceptable and extremely worrying. Never have I stayed in a hotel of this standard, got a suite costing thousands a night and had staff entering the room without knocking, at 21:15 at night.\n\nI immediately emailed and called the hotel. Spoke to someone extremely condescending which told me with a patronising tone that « they were looking into it » and cutting it short with an « alright! Have a good night! »\nFollowing the incident, I also received a response to my email. Simply justifying that the person who entered my room was « a security member who got it wrong » and they would offer me breakfast as a compensation. A breakfast which honestly was unnecessary as my babies do not eat it and my husband was not here. Poor compensation for such a prestigious hotel.\n\nThe next day, my husband went straight to speak to reception. Following his conversation with a member of the staff, we were moved to another room.\n\nIf it wasn’t for my husband, nothing would have been done and this wouldn’t have been taken seriously. Which is really alarming.\n\nI am more upset and shocked by the response I received when I called shortly after the incident than the incident itself (because although it was really uncomfortable to have someone walked in the room, it was apparently the member of staff’s first week and mistakes happen).\n\nBut the response I received, however, was completely out of order and dismissive. And offering a breakfast (for 1 person) was insulting.",

The location is great for folks that want to have access to the common hot spots as it's right next to the London Eye and across the bridge from Big Ben. But even better is that there is a bus station in front of the hotel and down the street is a major metro station so getting to the and from most areas was simple.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and welcoming and I thoroughly appreciated how they constantly greeted us with a smile and good morning/afternoon/evening.\n\nWe had a room that had a beautiful view of the river, London Eye, and the adjacent garden. Normally I would've been a little weary of a room that faced such a busting area but between the dual double-paned windows and the blackout drapes, we didn't hear any noise or see any lights when everything was closed/down. The bed was comfortable and was perfect for helping us fight jet lag, I fell asleep almost instantly after a long day of traveling and exploring the city. Everything in the room was clean and well kept; the toiletries were high end and you have access to the higher quality amenities such as robes, slippers, and a scale.\n\nThe club lounge was nice and served breakfast, happy hour, and snacks at certain points throughout the day which was lovely.\nGym is on the smaller side but was able to get the job done. There's also a indoor lap pool which is great for families or getting a good swim in.\n\nThe only two gripes we had were:\n1) It took an hour for the bellmen to bring up our suitcases from so we unfortunately missed a dinner reservation because we couldn't change clothes\n2) The hotel is very large, and there's only one set of elevators on one side of the building, so if you have a room on the opposite side of the hotel (like we did) you'll have a decently long walk just to get to the elevators to exit the hotel. A set of stairs an alternate entrance to the hotel on the side opposite the elevators would be a great addition if that is at all possible down the line.\n\nOtherwise, I would certainly come back to this property and I look forward to doing so during my next trip to London.",

      "text": "Incredible Marriott with Incredible Location\n\nMarriott knows my dog is a licensed credentialed certified Service Dog for disabilities.\n\nLow Points:\nThanks for a wonderful stay thanks to Phillip and Andrea.\n“Charlie\" at Security Saturday night blocked our entrance for 30 seconds with his hands across his hips saying “you’re not a guest here” (not asking first), as we arrived soaking wet in the rain from our long walk home, defiantly claiming “no dogs allowed in here.” Attendants in the M Lounge consistently telling me “but you’re not on the list” even though my key card allowed me access which Andrea consistently verified. The restaurant steakhouse told me they could not accommodate vegetarians easily. The very tall dark skinned gentleman who lurked around us every time we passed through the lobby as if waiting to throw us out (hotel security not knowing of service dog policy?). Amrie and my first check-in attempt asked me to pay my rooms but did NOT charge me for the additional night I added, making me have to go to front desk again and re-pay 7 hours later. Valentyna as one of the three trying to check me in 7 hours later tried upselling me both lounge access and breakfast included, repeating that I had neither despite the fact that Philip arranged something different with me earlier. She then insisted that “this would be for a coffee whilst you waited, not for your entire stay,” which was not true.\n\nThe hotel is so wonderful one just expects turn down service yet there is none...perhaps in the suites only?\n\nThe plastic artificial obvious grass in front of the front main spectacular entrance is just a shame and it lowers the quality of the property; even cement nicely shined would be nicer than investments in plastic these days.\n\nHigh Points: My stay was wonderful because of Philip at the Front Desk and Andrea in the Lounge. Ample universal, international plugs by the bed except for USB-C. Tea kettles in rooms with real milk are a plus.\n\nUnique Points:\nPhilip at the front desk should be a Front Desk Office Manager, not “just a front desk clerk.” I’m sure he’ll be promoted soon. He remembered my name, offered prosecco, gave me a tour, consistently checked on my stay, and welcomed me to contact him for future reservations (see below). I would come to stay at this property only and because he would look after my booking personally.\n\nEvery time you pass by after check in the front desk, you can have access to a glass of free-flowing bubbles champagne and water which is a REASON TO STAY HERE JUST BECAUSE OF THIS! ALWAYS WITH A SMILE WITH HELPFUL FEMALE STAFF AS LIASONS between waiting and the front desk as well. Incredible system.\n\nStunning views on Thames with one of the few last left grand dame hotels that's affordable is unique; and access to TWO bridges and the London Eye is incredible.\n\nThe M Lounge has breathtaking views. The Library version of M Lounge for breakfast is wonderful, and we had Jay on a \"good day\" and a day where he was \"off,\" which we're all allowed.\n\nWhen we finally got to the lounge for a snack that first evening, and finally had to prove myself deserving to be there, Andrea came over with champagne and said “we’re really glad you’re here staying with us.” That—and Philip’s welcome and the card I received from the hotel manager Meri K-- was the only single time we actually felt the spirit of hospitality of welcoming. At all other times it seemed we had to prove ourselves and my disability to be welcomed in this property. Not all disabilities are obvious, and staff must know this. Marriott knows my disability and has on record all of Biskits Guide Dogs International cards, which I’m happy to show any time I check in.\n\nI want to return to the property for the quality of my room, for its location and view, and for the genuine care and concern I felt from Philip exclusively at your property from all hotel staff.",

The service was top notch starting with whisking our suitcases away while we sipped sparkling wine or water as we waited to officially check in. This is not your typical Marriott experience. You can stay in less expensive places, certainly, but for the price this is actually a great value. The rooms are beautiful, We requested a Thames River view, and we were treated to a view of Big Ben and Parliament as well. The London eye could be seen from the window as well and is an easy walking distance for a great photo taking experience. The food in the hotel restaurant was delicious although not included in the price for our stay. Still the dining experience, including the beautifully delivered room service, was worth the cost. Room service was so lovely I preferred it to the restaurant after a long day of site seeing. Americans will appreciate both tea and delicious coffee available in the room. This hotel is a rest up haven!\n\nShout out to Mohammad for his help when checking in, Phillip for patiently answering all our questions including those about currency exchange, and all of the staff that helps to make entering and leaving with baggage absolutely seamless!",

Where the service let us down entirely was room service and Gilroys.\n\nRoom service was cold and zero condiments were brought with our food. We ordered hot milk with our coffee and it did not arrive, when it finally did our coffee was cold. The room service menu is limited and not what you expect from a 5-star hotel. Cheap junk food.\n\nDining in Gilroys although the food was nice the service was extremely slow. Painful really, 35 minutes to get drinks. And after 15 minutes we reminded them and still it took so long. While the waiters are polite and friendly efficiency in service in lacking. Really not what you expect from a 5-star. The Marriott Edition is far superior although does not boast the same location it's worth the 5 star tag.",

      "text": "I highly recommend this hotel, primarily for the location, service, and value! If you're looking for the best Marriott in London, this is easily it. While the Westminster/London Eye area is very crowded, we still found the location to be perfect; it was unbelievably special to be able to see Big Ben out the window throughout our entire trip, rather than feeling like we needed to go out of our way to see it once or twice. There are bus stops right outside the hotel, as well as two tube stops: Westminster across the bridge, then Waterloo a block or so away toward the Eye. The hotel has trustworthy connections with taxi drivers, so we let them arrange taxis for us on nice nights out. We walked most places, though! The room itself was very comfortable, much larger than European hotel rooms in my experience, but the view of Big Ben and the river was spectacular. There are two sturdy umbrellas in the room, which was great, but the bellmen also offered us umbrellas when it looked like we needed them. We ordered room service from Gillray's twice, which was great both times, but we also had a delivery of a birthday cake, flowers, champagne, and a card, which was beautifully presented...they did an outstanding job and were right on time. As far as hotel amenities go, the gym was surprisingly large, the restaurants were good (better to eat out), and the M Club Lounge was outstanding! The service was one of the most memorable aspects of the hotel. A young woman in the lobby each day was so kind, even offering to take trash from our hands and dispose of it for us. All of the bellmen were great - they were friendly, took great photos for us, arranged taxis for us, and more. We spoke to a local who said that he and his wife come stay there each Christmas to enjoy the city - I thought it was great to hear that a local also finds this hotel to be great! One thing to keep in mind throughout your trip is safety: the entrance to the hotel is off the beaten track, which is nice for security, but be careful when crossing Westminster Bridge as there are con artists and pick pockets there regularly. Let the hotel arrange taxis for you, so you know they're safe! Thank you to the staff of this hotel for an incredible experience!",

I've paid top prices to stay but now it's only for the location.\n\nNo mini bar, room service (in room dining) is completely gone unless you want to eat in a McDonald's type box and pay a huge fee just for the convenience. The pool may be going away,  the gym is being down sized (rumors),  the only thing left is the Library and Gilrays, without them would be no better than a Courtyard by Marriott.. (the Executive Lounge isn't too bad, used to be better) who wants to pay very high rates for a night of Courtyard type amenities.\n\nLet's talk about staff.. the bar and restaurant staff are incredible. The concierge (gone as well), the door staff are amazing,  but the hotel staff (all temps) are completely clueless. I've been staying here for so many years and I just am sick at how bad it is. I used to think having a high tier in Marriott meant something.  I guess that's only back in the States now.\n\nI never thought I would say this about my favorite Hotel in London.\n\nThe only reason the hotel won't change, is people are still paying for the location. One day it will stop. Marriott County Hall will probably never return to its formal glory, as an exec expecting the amenities I pay for I feel cheated.  It's a shame, it once was incredible.. not going to deny the rooms and scenery are incredible, access to the city is excellent. But when you've been staying as long as I have here for business and pleasure you notice the other things.",

I couldn’t think of anything that they missed.  I look forward to going back there when I can do some touring and not just staying in a beautiful room.  Absolutely loved the pictures on the walls.  If you’ve stayed there, you know what I mean.  Kudos to this hotel and their outdated staff!",

Thank you Michael.\n\nComing back to the hotel itself - the rooms have an amazing view, the beds are very comfortable, it's very quiet and the place is very child friendly, because ours were very happy.\n\nWe have very fond memories of the time spent in your hotel and hope that we will be able to visit you again sometime.\n\nI highly recommend!\n\nAn ideal hotel for couples and families with children.\n\nThank you all for making our Christmas so wonderful.\n\nBest regards,\nVelasco family.",

Let me start that my rate for a regular room was more than 500 pounds per night. I split my time in London between the Hilton Conrad and County Hall Marriott. I will start by saying that the County Hall Marriott IS NOT a five star hotel. I wish I had stayed at the Hilton Conrad the entire trip. There is an adequate attempt at checkin, but behind that, the hotel falls FLAT. It is in a great location near the London Eye and Westminster Abbey. On checkin, they offer a glass of sparkling wine. They do have a bell service. I am a Marriott Gold member and requested an upgrade as my status grants FREE upgrades if available The person I asked, prior to checkin and at checkin refused at all cost to grant an upgrade. Be only tied to make me pay for upgrades. I told him that I wanted to have access to the M Club as an upgrade because I was gold, which has NEVER been a problem anywhere else. He did we can do that for 80 pounds a nights. So I asked if I could be upgraded to a river view, he said no. The then tried to give me a “garden” views, which is worse as that is a “NO VIEW” there. He was called into his managers office who instructed him to give me a river view as an upgrade. It was NOT that difficult. I tipped the attendant handsomely despite his lack of customer focus.\n\nI went to the room which was mediocre for at “5- star hotel”. At 500 pounds per night, I would have expected more, but it gets worse. I started to take a shower and there was no shower gel in this expensive hotel. I only had one very small (US Half-Dollar Sized) piece of soap. Again, this is it 5-star. There was no wet bar. There was nothing that one would expect for the price or star rating. I requested two shower gels for my two day stay and they brought ONE!!! I laughed.\n\nThe steak house at the hotel is OK, but not worth the price. My un garnished steak was ok and the potatoes were undercooked. I didn’t complain as my expectation of this Marriott were shot!\n\nGiven the fact that my time was off, I was awake at 1:30 AM and really wanted a Diet Coke. I went to the lobby and inquired, where I could get one. At first they stated that they had Pepsi in the M Lounge and I was hopeful I could get one. I told them I was not given access, thinking they could go get me a canned\n\nPEPSI. They told me I could walk down the street to a 24 hour store. Unbelievable, this actually happened at my 500 pound per night hotel without soap.\n\nOverall. I do not recommend this hotel. I would rather stay at the Holiday inn. This is not a 5-Star hotel and is much over priced for the value.",

However, if there is anything that can be improved to make it even better is housekeeping, I believe housekeeping should not just be only changing bedsheets and disposing garbage, but to tidy up the room and to make the room like home for the people who stays in it, such as folding up clothes on the sofa, tidying up the table because not a day our coffee table was wiped, putting a cloth under the toiletries in the bathroom, putting back the slippers and hair dryer, we stayed for a week and not a day our bathtub was cleaned after our usage, replacing the laundry bag, there are many more that can be improved in regards to housekeeping to make the stay even better, thats hospitality, to provide guests a wonderful feeling of “Home”.",

I was seated outside and it took about 10 minutes for the waiter to take my order. He seemed unfamiliar with the menu so I assume he was new. After I ordered (a non-alcoholic drink and a cheese plate) I proceeded to wait another 20 minutes while all of the people that came and sat after me received their drinks. The waiter paid no notice to me. I eventually just flagged him over and told him to cancel my order.\n\nIs this just how hotel service works in the UK? I was shocked and will not be returning.\n\nAlso I would suggest that if you have a new staff member at a more upscale hotel that you have a more experienced server with him or her to ensure your customers receive the service they deserve.",

But just in case your assistant’s assistant is reading this review, I’ll say that this is easily my favorite hotel in the world. The staff isn’t just wonderful in all departments, they actually anticipate your needs and take care of you. Staying at the Ham Yard is the most effortless experience imaginable. It is how all hotel stays should be and, as such, is the measuring stick by which all hotels should be measured. The only hotels I’ve ever seen come close to The Ham Yard are their sister hotel The Covent Garden Hotel and the Hotel Palácio de Vilapanes in Seville.\n\nI don’t want to belabor my point, but the rooms are perfect (with the most wonderful RikRak amenities and the softest sheets and towels), they genuinely make traveling with toddlers a dream, and the dining room and bar are fantastic. High Tea at the Ham Yard is a delicious, luxurious experience not to be missed.\n\nI cannot wait to have my assistant’s travel assistant book another stay soon.",

Even after the afternoon tea set was brought to us, we asked if we could take a photo. It was a pleasant service that was considerate 😊\n\nThe store is divided into several spaces, including a bar space, a garden space, and a tea space, so it was easy to spend time with children even if they were a little restless.\nWe also enjoyed the long-awaited afternoon tea, the cake was delicious without being too sweet, and we were able to enjoy a variety of sandwiches such as salmon sandwich, tuna sandwich, egg sandwich, and cheese sandwich.\nThe afternoon tea set alone was £40, and the one with sparkling champagne was £53. (2023.3.22) The price is also reasonable compared to other tea salons and is highly recommended ❤️",

There seems to be very limited turnover of staff and it’s great to see the same friendly faces on every visit.\n\nI’ve lived in Asia for more than two decades, and throughout that time I’ve always said that my favourite hotel is the iconic Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong.

Covent Garden Hotel was far and away the best overall experience I have ever had. Our arrival, me and my 83-year-old Mom, was anticipated, welcoming and we were made to feel like royalty from the moment we stepped out of our car and onto the property. Every staff member I spoke with told us how lucky they were to work there, which was reflected in every detail of the flawless service they provided. After a day out, walking back onto to property felt like coming home. Their dinner and entertainment recommendations were spot on. Because of the wonderful experience we had, we are looking into adding a few days to the end of our UK trip, just so we can return to the Covent Garden Hotel. A special shout-out to Mikey, Patricia, Agostinho, and Nicky for making this very special Mother-Daughter trip one we will never forget.",

The interior is newly remodeled so the room I got was wonderful with a seating area. The bedding is fantastic. There are two restaurant choices. Any bar within this property with I think 50 units max. In the basement there is a gym, pool and spa. Next to the main building there is a heated outdoor pool.\n\nThe only reason I did not give this place five stars is because the service is inconsistent. I think the intention is to go above and beyond on service but the the quality of service is lacking, something that can probably be rectified through better training. For example, I had to call three times over 9 hour. One day to have my mini bar addressed. The mini bar was not working. After the first call. No one showed up. After the second call someone may have showed up. After the third call, they decided to move a portable fridge in the middle of my hotel room. A picture is included. It was not a solution fitting a self-proclaimed luxury place. Another example, I sent out my Blazer for cleaning. It's a new blazer I bought on the same trip in Paris prior to driving to London. The blazer came back worse than I sent it out. Full of white lint from somewhere. With the interior wrinkled probably due to the handling. On another day during my stay I sent out a white shirt to be clean and folded. It came back hung and not pressed. A picture is included as well. There are many other examples but I think you get the point. On the brightest side, some of the staff do try to go above in the eye. For example they helped book a restaurant reservation for a group of 10 just hours before dinner. Another example, I was given plenty of help trying to print.\n\nOverall, a nice place to have a business meeting for a few days or a getaway. I would come back but I hope the service improves.",

Unfortunately our whole family stay experience at The Langley was downgraded in the end and it became very unpleasant for our family holiday: Apparently the hotel only make effort to serve you if you’re able to pay for the entire property and they’ll kick other guests out.\n\nWe had an evening flight back home from Heathrow on the check-out day and the day before I was about to ask for a babysitter for our boys so that me and my husband could enjoy the SPA after check-out in the afternoon. When I approached the reception desk, the lady told me: oh but nobody is allowed to be here tomorrow. At first I was confused. It turned out that on our check-out day, someone bought the entire property and the lady at the reception literally told me: well you know when you’re spending that much money, you don’t want someone else to be here. The way how she talked, sounds ridiculous indeed.\n\nLater I figured out that the hotel required all the guests leave by 12 noon and all the facilities (restaurants, bars, spa, public grounds etc.) won’t be available for use since they need to clean the entire property. I once again asked to speak to a manager and expressed my concerns, as I felt rather unpleasant because nobody informed us regarding this issue before and we only found out the day before; meaning we will have to find elsewhere and other entertainment before our flight at our own expense as we weren’t able (and not welcomed) to stay on the hotel premises.\n\nThe manager was arrogant as well, her first response was and insisted that we didn’t “lose” anything because the policy is that the check-out time is at 12 noon. There’s no service recovery for us, even if it’s completely the hotel’s management fault as it failed to give us the notice promptly, the attitude I learned from The Langley is: We have another guest paying a lot of money so other guests need to leave.\n\nThe next day, we drove back with the taxi to the hotel and we were waiting for our stored luggage to be delivered to us. It took a few minutes longer and while we were waiting, our taxi driver was asked if he could drive his car further away back to the main gate since the wedding couple is soon arriving.\n\nSurely, someone could spend their money and rent the whole property, well then since the one who spends the most money matters most, may I kindly advise that the next time, let your guest also pay the extra to rent the night before, so you’re assure of that no other guest will be on property.\n\nA guest is a guest, you shall show your best; no hotel should ever classify their guests base on the amount of money they spend, every guest shall be treated equally and with respect. Shame on you, The Langley.",

Staff was great, room was clean and nice and the food and drinks were great; there was just one thing that really bothered me...\n\nBehind the outdoor pool is a small pen with two pygmy goats. Feeding, grooming and keeping the pen clean were all A+, but as a person who has had pygmy goats, it was clear that both were depressed since they do not get out of the pen to run free and play (there are dogs everywhere here).  I've never seen two young goats so docile. Of course they perk up if someone has food but I visited them multiple times...they did not know how to play like regular goats and their demeanor was strange as though hey were sedated.\n\nGoats are very playful and lively creatures, love humans and are sweet natured. To be hidden behind the pool and the 10' hedgerow is cruel enough, but these creatures deserve better than a lovely little prison pen. Filling their mental health needs is a must as well. Additionally, there was one peacock left out of 8 (I was told by multiple staff members) because the foxes had killed the rest.  If I had known animals were being used as entertainment I would have not booked here. I do not believe people are booking this beautiful hotel because there are two pygmy goats behind the pool.\n\nLangley Management: please find other ways to entertain children at the hotel and find those goats a good home where they can run and all-around healthy.",

Perfect getaway to relax and enjoy the countryside just outside of London.\n\nPaulo on the front desk was so pleasant, despite it being around midnight. He very kindly carried our bags up and checked us in with zero hassle.\n\nThe room was one of the main highlights. Staff went above and beyond to make it special with the turndown service and welcome drinks in the room. Very comfortable and a beautiful view.\n\nBreakfast was wonderful with an amazing view. The fresh juice variation was very refreshing. A halal meat option would’ve been nice but not a requirement at all.\n\nPaul from housekeeping was very kind, helping us with fresh towels. John from the front desk also was very helpful and kindly brought us fresh ice for our drinks. Robin kindly helped as well over the phone. Even Abby in the spa gave us a lovely little tour with such friendliness.\n\nBiggest of thank yous must go to Kerena. She went above and beyond to make this stay very special. Her and I were in contact for weeks before my stay to ensure everything was perfect, and it was. She arranged a few specific things that were required and made it no hassle at all. Could not speak any more highly of her and the service provided. Looking forward to more stays at the Langley!",

Stayed in room 53 which is out of the main hotel - cute cottage vibes with country views! Room service was 5-star ... try the Arancini and Cold meat cuts with Gnocco fritto!\n\nStunning when the sun is shinning however still excellent on the drizzlier days. The grounds are great for walks, bike rides, with a beautiful outdoor pool and if you're lucky you can meet the pygmy goats - Nutmeg and Cinnamon! All the team at the hotel are super helpful, kind and attentive, Jana on the front desk is extremely delightful in every way and Adam (on his first week) was such a pleasure to speak to!\n\nAvailable spaces for laptop working which is ideal.\n\nBeautiful spa space (sauna, steam, indoor pool) with a great gym (ski erg, rower, sled, squat rack which was a treat as not all gyms have this!)\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Firstly, I'd like to start by saying I never leave negative reviews and It has been several months since our stay as I wanted to reflect on our time there and also contact the hotel first, which sadly I haven't heard back from...so here we are!\n\nWe booked this hotel for our wedding night last June, to stay after our small ceremony. We booked dinner for that evening and also a spa day for 2 the following day to truly relax and enjoy the weekend.\n\nWe had a few drinks as we arrived, it was a lovely evening so we sat on the terrace. The gardens were very bog standard, just fields with some hedge borders around which were pleasant but generally feel like a lot more could be invested in the gardens for such a luxury hotel.\n\nDinner was nice but the atmosphere in the dinning room was incredibly flat, almost awkward. There were maybe a dozen tables but you could have heard a pin drop. There was no music or ambiance, it was very strange and we quickly finished our meal and headed to our room.\n\nAs we arrived in our room, there were rose petals on the bed which was a nice touch and a bottle of red wine with a note to say 'congratulations!', we opened this and settled into our evening- this wine appeared on our bill the next day which was a shame.\n\nThe rooms were comfortable, boutique style. You couldn't see out of the window so it felt dark but it was clean and the bed was nice. We paid extra for breakfast in bed but things like sauces/ drinks didn't come up with the breakfast.\n\nThe most disappointing part was the spa experience; this was not cheap and we have visited many leading spa's around the world but this certainly wasn't luxury. Firstly, there were several children in the spa which we weren't expecting for a luxury spa. We have our own children and of course love all children, but this took away from our relaxing experience when being splashed on our beds. Again, there was no relaxing music, no spa smell- it actually smelt of bleach which was really strong. Not what you'd expect. No water or refreshments were available in the spa area, nor any reading material. We headed outside to the pool area, this was incredibly dirty, with quite a thick layer of sediment floating on top of the water, it looked like it hadn't been cleaned for weeks. The shower was out of order next to the pool so we couldn't even wash after getting out. The sunbeds were worn out and looked even mouldy in some areas. There was electrical extension leads visible as well as some tools nearby to.\n\nWe each had a massage after, which was honestly really un enjoyable. The therapist was nice enough but I walked into the room and it was bright lights and again no atmosphere. The massage wasn't relaxing at all, the girl kept putting her elbow in my shoulder blade which was agony! Again, I regularly get massages at Spa's whilst away and i've just never experienced one like this before.\n\nThe general look of the Hotel was pretty poor when you look closely- The finish on the paint is incredibly messy, there was still lots of red spray paint on the lovely stone steps in reception. Just loads of snagging we noticed which added to the disappointment.\n\nFinally, our bill upon check out was £1353.50 which we would have happily paid for our wedding night, had the hotel lived up to expectation and its 'luxury' name. It was far from this!!\nI did email the hotel my thoughts before posting this review, but its been months and I have not heard back. I would never stay here again especially as its expensive and doesn't compare with some other gorgeous hotels in the area!",

      "text": "I came here for a spa morning (9am - 1pm) and was blown away by just how amazing this spa is - the best I've been to by far and I've been to a lot of spas! Firstly, the grounds and hotel building itself is stunning. I was walked to the spa by a gentleman on reception, which was a lovely touch and was then met by a very friendly spa receptionist. Once I was shown to the changing rooms, I was pleased to see that they were big, super clean and gorgeous. The spa itself is stunning and even has a women's only area, which is amazing! I used all of the facilities alone which was dreamy, as they told me they limit numbers to ensure it's never crowded. The staff are super friendly and go above and beyond to make you feel welcome - it was my birthday and they even prepared a little birthday treat for me 🥰 Lunch was delicious and included the biggest, tastiest Tiramisu I've ever eaten! I've already started looking at dates for coming back. I had a 90 minute massage which was also incredible. 100% recommend - I will be returning 😊",

The service and attention to detail throughout the day was unmatched by anywhere else I have been too. The 1hr 30 minute treatment with Diana and Alayna was the best full body massage we have ever had! They took so much care in carrying out a pre-treatment consultation followed by the best massage ever! Would highly recommend the Langley Spa, it is pricey however you pay for quality. I would definitely return.",

When we first arrived on the first night we were quite tired from driving all the way from Edinburgh. The staffs and receptionists greeted us with happy faces and makes us forget about our tiredness. Thank you to Stuart for kindly helped us with our massive and many luggages. On the next day, we had a lovely breakfast and the staff there were all amazing, happy and funny-they recommend us take the bike and tour around the ground-which was an amazing experience. We love our room, the pool, and especially the ground. They even allow us to check out late bc our flight was going to be at night, so we got to stay till 5 pm. Special thank you to Wendy, Shirley, and Stuart for making our last stay in London very memorable. We’ll definitely come all the way from Malaysia to experience the hotel again",

The service was on the whole amazing. I mean amazing. The staff are in the background but will actively engage with their guests should anything be required. Hats off to the staff and management for getting this just right.\n\nThe food was high quality, well presented and scrumptious.\n\nThe Langley deserves five stars, it really should, however I felt I can not extend the extra star on this occasion.\n1. Our server, who was also allegedly the bar manager, was ill equipped to provide assurance with regards to the claim the food was halal  I.e. when questioned how could we be assured the food was halal and merely responding that the hotel was owned by a Lebanese business man and leaving it as that is simply not enough and to be honest pathetic! If you do not know surely you would offer to find out perhaps? which he was unwilling to do and seemed to think his answer would quite obviously be enough.\n2. Unfortunately the same server seemed to have a chip on his shoulder or something as he came across cold and arrogant which made us all feel a little uncomfortable and dampened this part of our evening.\n\nPerhaps this was our bad luck, perhaps he was having a bad day as all the other servers and staff we met were incredible and very welcoming. I don't know.\n\nNevertheless the Langley is worth your time and needs to be appreciated.",

First of all, Baby cot mattress is the cheap sponge one covered with white plastic. It’s definitely not breathable hence not safe. For a 5 star hotel that provides guests comfortable pocket spring mattress with goose down duvet, why isn’t it possible to provide safe sleeping options for babies?? Secondly, the in-room fridge doesn’t work. Sent an engineer to fix it but still not working. So drinks in the bridge is room temperature and can’t store baby food. Thirdly, stay away from suites on the second floor. The ceiling height in the middle of the room is so low that if you are 180cm+, you will hit your head easily. Lastly, called the hotel to book an early dinner. Was told the earlier slots at 6:30pm are booked. When we arrived at the hotel at 7:05pm. There was only one table with the rest completely empty. What is this? Stayed in many 5 star hotels in the U.K. and around the world and this is the worst experience so far.",

Sky TV included for those who don’t want to leave their room. Food was excellent, so was the service. \n \nI used the gym which was surprisingly fully equipped for a hotel gym! We spent time in the pool, jacuzzi and sauna. \n\nThe hotel is set in very scenic surroundings, where you can go on walks taking in the flora and fauna. \n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable stay. If you’re looking to treat yourself and get away for a weekend or so, the Langley hits the spot.",

The lobby is ok, the bar and restaurant areas are nicely decorated, which we could see clearly because over a space that could host 300 people there was one table of 3. It had zero atmosphere, which you could say was because it was a Sunday, but that’s just not true of that area anymore - the other side of Liv St st. is always buzzing. As one of the other reviews said, the rooms have tried to be too clever for their own good, the humble bedside lamps flicker because the control panels, situated everywhere and will keep you awake, must need some kind of mad charge that simpler things don’t. We tried for 20 mins to close one of our blinds using said panel, which stuttered down the window about 1/5 of the way before we gave up and accepted it was broken. The Junior Suite is a decent size, good bathtub, but current expectations for 5* are sorely lacking. The Bang & Olufsen TV is 00’s style over substance and is like having your first freeview box 15 years ago. The remote was rancid - god knows how many years of grime were in those buttons. Toiletries nothing to write home about and are hugely wasteful single use plastic and synthetic feeling/ scented. Staff lacklustre and unhelpful, spa facilities not all in use - and been closed for at least 2 weeks so not a priority to get up and running for guests who have booked hoping to use spa facilities - cost of living affecting everyone, I guess. There are far superior hotels in this area and I would definitely give this place a miss. In my view it's barely a 3* let alone 4* and not even close to a 5*.",

      "text": "I had an extremely disappointing experience during my stay at the South Place Hotel in London, which is advertised as a luxurious five-star establishment. My experience was far from the expectations associated with such a rating.\n\nUpon our arrival at the hotel, we were taken aback when we were asked to pay a deposit of 125 euros. This was surprising because I had already paid for our room using my Amex card through their online booking system. However, to our dismay, when it came time to place the deposit, we were informed that they did not accept Amex. This was frustrating, but what made matters worse was the receptionist's insensitive comment. The gentleman, who had a receding hairline, condescendingly remarked, \"You do realize you need to enter the correct code.\" This comment was not only unhelpful but also humiliating.\n\nOur experience continued to deteriorate throughout our stay. The hotel was hosting a wedding event at the same time, which led to several disruptions. Throughout the night, boisterous wedding guests repeatedly banged on our door, making it impossible to get a good night's sleep. While I understand that weddings can be festive affairs, this level of disturbance was unacceptable for a purportedly upscale hotel.\n\nThe following morning, due to our sleep-deprived state, I called the reception to request a late check-out, asking for an extension until 12:30 instead of the standard 12:00. This request was reasonable given the circumstances, but it was met with reluctance and a lack of understanding from the hotel staff.\n\nThe most distressing incident occurred upon check-out. We had left our seven bags in the hotel's storage area while we explored the city. However, when we returned later in the afternoon, eager to catch a train, we were handed only six of our bags. It took me a moment to realize the missing bag was my briefcase, which contained sensitive documents and my laptop. When we initially entrusted our bags to the hotel, I had explicitly emphasized the importance of handling the briefcase with utmost care. To my shock and dismay, the same receptionist who had taken and returned our bags asserted, \"Sir, I can assure you that we did not receive a briefcase from you.\" This statement sent me into a panic, as the briefcase was vital for my work. In my state of distress, which must have been evident, I implored her to recheck. Reluctantly, she walked towards the storage room, and after an agonizing wait, she reemerged with my briefcase. This entire episode left me feeling highly anxious and frustrated.\n\nIn light of these numerous disappointments and inconveniences, I firmly believe that I deserve a refund of approximately £350 as compensation for the subpar service and the anxiety I experienced during my stay at the South Place Hotel. This level of service is not in line with the standards expected of a five-star hotel, and I hope that my feedback will prompt improvements in the future.",

Cleaning staff was available almost instantly when we asked for additional water or lotion, etc..

No offer of water like other bars. He poured out 3 large glasses which always annoys me particularly when the wine is not properly cooled. We topped up the rest ourselves. A large Arab family with children installed themselves right next to us, using our chairs with help from the waiter. We were unable due the noise to continue our conversation so we moved. We moved the glasses, the hopeless cooler and the unreplenished ice cubes ourselves. There was plenty of room in the bar but no one helped us. He only managed to pour out the very last drop of wine of course because he wanted us to order another.\nFor this great service they added on 15% £7.20 for service which was non existent.  I was with clients so I did not challenge it. So the bill was £55.20 for a warm bottle of average wine.\nWe won't be going back",

When we came back we were handed a key card, not told what room number or how to find the room or any details on breakfast the next day which we had paid for or details on checking out. Ultimately there was no communication and no welcoming/friendly experience from staff. Breakfast the next day was no better, we had to ask for drinks and then waited over half an hour for a relatively simple breakfast in a very quiet restaurant. Lots of extras in the room, but most have to be paid for in addition to the cost of the room, which we felt overall was not worth the price.",

      "text": "This was my second stay at the South Place Hotel, and most certainly will not be my last. My wife and I came to London for a New Years Eve getaway. After looking at a lot of other hotels in London, we had decided nothing looked as good as what we experienced at this hotel during our prior stay. This hotel is away from a lot of the hustle and bustle of London, but that is part of what makes it so special. The rooms are spacious and clean. There are a lot of places in London that have a good location and room quality, but I think what really sets the South Place Hotel apart is the quality of it's staff. Everyone we encountered was extremely helpful and kind, from the staff at the front desk to the waiters at the Chop House restaurant that is connected to the downstairs lobby. I want to give a special shout out to one of the bartenders that had taken care of us at 3 Bar (also located within the hotel lobby). Santiago was probably the best hotel bartenders I have ever come across. In fact, bartender is probably an insult. He is more of a mixologist. We were totally blown away with the drinks that he made for us. After a few rounds, he had made some suggestions of other drinks to try based off what we were drinking. He knocked it out of the park with every single drink, so much so that I had to get a few of his recipes so that I could make them at home. We ended up not bothering to drink at outside bars or restaurants because the best bar we had found was right downstairs from our hotel room.",

It seems like for the package you don’t get everything included, frustrating as this was the main reason we booked our stay.  Additionally, the front of house staff hadn’t reviewed our booking with us or given us the chance to spend additional so we could get the full experience.\n\nWe left feeling like second class citizens, which I know sounds a bit dramatic with everything that is going on in the world but the way we were treated just didn’t measure up to what we had seen online.\n\nI hate to leave a slightly negative review, but I wouldn’t go back.\n\nDespite this, the saving grace of the hotel is that the restaurant; the food we did have was delicious - and you can certainly see why it is so highly rewarded.",

And personally, I found our room’s decor to be somewhat outdated and had a cramped feeling because the ceilings were quite low. The other issue I came across was that the hot water in the bath/shower was very difficult to control and at times would suddenly become scalding hot. There also seemed to be a nest of pigeons right outside the room and so early in the morning (5am) we were woken up by the squawking. There were some nice touches to the experience, like a welcome-box of shortbread cookies which were delicious  and sweets at turn down. Finally, location-wise, if you are looking to take public transport, it is a bit of a walk to the nearest underground. There is a bus that goes by but it’s quite slow.",

The room and facilities were first class. What really stood out was the personnel and the service. These people were so gracious, knowledgeable and helpful. We will never forget the service and kindness we were shown. I could name people but I’m concerned I’d miss someone. Location was a real plus. Right across from Hyde Park and its beautiful gardens and paths. If possible try two of their recommendations, Memories of India, and the Chinese restaurant atop the Royal Gardens hotel across the street. Get the Beijing duck. Unforgettable. A+++ for the Milestone.",

We felt this keept us engaged and feeling comfortable within the Hotel.\n\nThe Breakfast was plentiful and could be well catered for any requests & we did also book in ( and would highly recommend ) the Sunday Roast in their restaurant also !\n\nIt was an incredible stay and we can't thank the staff enough for making it so.",

One time over 7 days I was slightly disappointed and that was only because I was trying to order food after the posted end time on bar food when room service was available. Really, a me problem.\n\nLocation: I had not stayed in Kensington before.  I had always stayed to the East in central London. Had no idea what I was missing. Great experience. Less tourism and more high end living.\n\nRoom: so hard for us with two parents and 4 kids.  But the room delivered.  It involved a cot only because we got offensive lineman children.  I slept in three different beds (parents) and all were great. I had to navigate to find the perfect flat pillow (stomach sleeper) (me problem).\n\nI could not have been happier with our stay and deeply thank all the staff (so many good people).  We will be back and maybe next time for a month. Week was not enough.\n\nThank you Laura Madrid for again finding an epic place for us. You impress everywhere we go.",

      "text": "We had a walk in breakfast in Milestone few days ago, so we’re not one of those guests who could get room upgrades or chocolate covered strawberries in case of a dissatisfaction which is a norm in hotels in Kensington area.\nBeing someone retired from this sector, and as a writer now, I couldn’t keep myself from writing this review.\nDuring our breakfast, there was a constant panic mode in the restaurant and tense feeling; even though the staff was trying to do their best. It was very obvious that the staff was under pressure and suffering during their marathon in and out of the kitchen, and to the other room they serve breakfast, to bring the food as fast as they could.\nWe could see them sweating, miserable.\nYou can also hear the constant banging and some crashing kind of noise from the kitchen.\nThese all give you a sad, as well as a rush feeling which tells you to finish and leave.\nMilestone is serving a good breakfast, but I don’t think people like us who are neighbors would enjoy it when it was obvious that they don’t take care of the wellbeing of their employees. Everyone knows that this sector is suffering and if you want to see why it is suffering arrange a visit to Milestone for breakfast.\nGood luck to all those amazing women that served us.",

Especially the vegetarian selection.\n\nWe would really recommend anyone looking for a special hotel in London to stay here.\n\nThe only criticism is the dinner (a la carte). Here we had the feeling that the prices are a bit too expensive for what you get. Wine prices are absolutely fine. But especially the vegetarian selection is not very large. And with a fructose intolerance it becomes difficult. The staff has always tried to find a solution however. Nevertheless, for what you get compared to other exclusive and Michelin star restaurants around the world, it is simply too expensive.",

Every single employee we encountered went above and beyond to make sure we are satisfied with our stay. Everyone was so friendly, professional and helpful. Their afternoon tea was to die for as well. We had few requests prior to our stay, and when we arrived the staff made sure everything is in order to our liking. This is a true 5 stars hotel. We can’t wait to go back!",

Staff was super friendly, helpful, and kind. The room was amazing…luxurious, beautiful, posh. Turndown service every evening with candies left on the bed. As a woman traveling alone, they made me feel safe, welcome, and looked after.\n\nChampagne afternoon tea service was amazing!! Be prepared to eat a lot. Tea was fantastic…I miss it already.\n\nDinner at Chenestons was ok. The food was well prepared, but the choices on the menu weren’t anything I was excited about.\n\nCocktails in the lounge were the finest! Angelo is an amazing mixologist; incredibly creative and knowledgeable in his craft. Their smoked old fashioned is a must have. And ask Claire to make a hot toddy…you won’t be disappointed!\n\nThe breakfast was equally amazing as the tea service. I had the smoked salmon scrambled eggs on toast. So delicious!\n\nThe hotel is right across from Hyde Park which has numerous walking paths for a leisurely stroll after breakfast or afternoon tea. If it’s a rainy day, their doorman will set you up with one of their umbrellas.\n\nThe concierge staff was very helpful and kind. One man asked for reservations for somewhere that served beef Wellington for him and his wife. The concierge called around, found a restaurant, checked on available reservations, let the guest know, and booked it for him. They'll call taxis for you, set up tours, etc. Excellent customer service!",

The daily cleaning was very attentive and thorough. The interior is stylish and beautiful\nThe 24/7 room service with delicous dishes saved me sometimes when I got back hungry. Next time I hope to explore more of the culinary possibilities as they look promising, but during Carnival I was often just exhausted when returning or too late.\nThe Spa is basic. There is a Finnish sauna and a pool with a counter-current system. It‘s definitely not a wellness hotel, but completely ok to relax a bit. Thanks to the exceptional service, they managed to organise a wonderful sports massage on a Sunday at very short notice for a very limited time slot. This was more that you can expect and it really saved me so I was fit for the Monday parade.\nThe best thing at the end. The exceptionally friendly and attentive service, which I have never experienced in this way before combined with a big dash of British charm.\nThanks to everybody there and I really hope to return soon. I can absolutely recommend the Milestone.",

We returned home on his birthday evening to a birthday cake, a steam train toy, and a very sweet personalized birthday card signed by 15 of the staff. My son was so overjoyed and felt really special! We've barely departed but our whole family cannot wait to return. We love staying in different properties when we return to cities, but in London we will absolutely come back to the Milestone!",

Alex deserves his Michelin star and I have no doubt he will continue to rise.\n\nThank you to all the team for a magical weekend getaway!",

      "text": "16th Century Premier Inn .. Just awful\n1 night b&b stay in august (£400 a night..)\nStarting with the good, and it is limited. The building and particularly the garden / grounds are pleasant to walk around and there was clearly a desire from the staff to try and help you enjoy yourself. Many of them are very young and inexperienced teenagers there for summer work.\nThe negatives are unfortunately extensive sadly, firstly the whole plot is next to the m25, the end of the garden is about 20m from the motorway and it is extremely loud and for me noticeable throughout the property even towards the far end. This ruins the garden completely. We spent the afternoon in the outdoor pool area, its not just tired its pretty much falling apart. The prices are eye watering and service was poor, always forgetting items and one staff for about 20 ppl all waiting and waiting for a drink. After a warm white wine out of a cheap plastic cup we tried the food, the sandwiches could have been something from a motorway stop. We ate in the evening in the standard hotel restaurant, and this is where it just went from bad to a bit of a scam.  The dining room tables are plastic, no tablecloth and several very young clueless waiters bringing in cold food that would barely pass in a Wetherspoon but of course all priced as though it was a central London fine dining experience. Fish and chips with undercooked potato and a duck leg in a strange lentil soup thing. It was a cross between dog food and school dinners. More warm white wine. We couldn’t finish any of it and went to bed quickly. Cant imagine what the 'Michelin' star lot were getting next door presumably from the same kitchen.\nFinal straw was waking up at 4am to the sound of the roaring m25 in a rock hard Ikea like bed wondering how it all went so wrong.\nThis hotel had its prime a long time ago and the new owners are I expect either trying to recover their costs, perhaps still form covid, or trying to make a quick profit. There is no way this is close to 5 star and i think it would struggle to even reach 4.\nI rarely take the time to leave a review but just felt this was so bad i needed to warn others, i can see one or two others from the posts have had a similar experience. Strongly recommend you give it a miss !",

      "text": "Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. We paid £365 for one night, including £80 towards dinner, and breakfast. The hotel is marketed as being a 5-star luxury hotel, but it simply isn't. As a hotel experience, it's not even 3-star. I feel like we were deceived and we paid well over the odds for the experience we had. This was especially upsetting as we were celebrating our anniversary.\n\nThe good:\n\n- The grounds are absolutely beautiful and well maintained. You can enjoy a nice walk around the gardens and there's lots of interesting outdoor artwork to enjoy.\n- The building itself has plenty of history and is certainly charming.\n\nThe meh:\n\n- The outdoor pool was okay. It was nice to be in a heated pool outside, but it wasn't particularly clean. Several of the 'fresh' pool towels were very clearly stained. They had large orange patches on them, which was the rust from the sun loungers. Why are these towels being put out if they're covered in stains?\n- The bar by the outdoor pool was mediocre. They didn't have fresh juice; it was like a carton of juice from Lidl. I expected a lot more from a 5-star hotel. Not to mention that everything drink comes with a 12.5% service charge. If you fancy a pint of London Pride, it will set you back £9.\n\nThe bad (everything else):\n\n- The room. Room 18 (Judge Doderidge) was very small and particularly hot. I'm willing to overlook this given the age of the building, but be prepared to get very hot in the summer. The bedsheets were visibly stained in multiple places, which was not nice, and certainly not 5-star.\n- The service. The staff were very inexperienced and did not look like they knew what they were doing. It was almost as if they were playing dress-up. At dinner, there was one older Italian waiter bossing around the younger staff, while he did nothing but chat with clientele. I found it very telling that, as we checked out, they didn't even ask how our stay was! Surely that's the first thing any hotel asks. It's almost like they know it's bad but they'd rather bury their heads in the sand.\n- The food. Probably the worst thing about the stay. The Estate Grill is essentially selling overpriced pub food. My partner ordered the haddock, but the menu didn't mention is was battered, so it was just bog-standard fish and chips. I also noted that the online 'sample menu' was a lot more elaborate than the actual menu we received. The breakfast was worse. Watery scrambled egg, hard sausages, and the fruit was tasteless. I've had better breakfasts at a Premier Inn.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this hotel. It's a real shame as the grounds are beautiful and the building is fantastic. However, the service and food offered fall far short of 5-stars and the price for the stay was far too high. My suggestion to management is to properly train your staff and make some serious upgrades on your food offering. There also needs to be some reinvestment in the pool area and much better quality control on cleaning standards. The hotel has the potential to be great, but at the moment it's really disappointing. The website and pictures are very misleading.",

The pool area is beautiful and luckily the weather was hot so it felt like a holiday.\n\nThe hotel receptionist whose name I didn't get but had lovely eye make up and an Australian/NZ accent was great, super friendly and genuine.\n\nThe spa experience was very underwhelming. The therapist doing my treatments appeared to be in a bad mood until my treatments were over. She made no conversation with me on the walk over to the spa and when I tried to talk to her she didn't respond. I had a 55 minute massage and 55 minute facial and by the time she left the room only 90 minutes has passed, so 20 minutes of treatment just never happened.\nI have had a lot of treatments in a lot of spas around the world and I have never had a massage where the therapist didn't ask what kind of pressure I would like or if I have any areas of concern. She didn't even ask if the pressure she was applying was okay (I could barely feel it). At no point, did she massage my arms or hands so it just felt unfinished. For my facial, she didn't ask what skin type I had in order to customise it, again, something I've never experienced before in my life. I've also never had a facial that didn't include a shoulder and chest massage while the mask is applied. While the mask was applied she very very gently rubbed my face over the top of the towel that was on my forehead. It was quite a weird feeling to be honest.\nI left the spa with a very thick residue of product on my face that I had to wash off in the bathroom because it was in chunks all over my face.\nI would definitely come back here again, but only for the pool experience, for the price I paid the spa was very unsatisfactory",

Gone were the smoked salmon sandwich and the rare roast beef, replaced by coronation chicken and egg mayonnaise with watercress options.\n\nHey ho, gave it a go, and don't bother would be my advice. The watercress was missing from the egg mayonnaise sandwich. Don't understand how a Michelin star restaurant can't get 2 ingredients into a simple sandwich. So started on the coronation chicken, and the brown sourdough was robust to say the least. After pointing out the issue with the watercress and had that provided, we then found the egg mayonnaise sandwich sourdough was downright stale. I cannot see how any kitchen, let alone one for a five star establishment, can't tell when bread is stale. Hence the public negative review.",

I had a burger for £26 that was supposed to be wagyu and beef brisket but I am pretty sure it wasn't anything else than a burger patty from Aldi or Asda, the fries were old and reheated. The patty was overcooked and honestly you can get a better burger at McDonald's for £3. The pate we had a starter wasn't even a pate and more like a cold meatloaf. I give 2 stars because the service was good and the outside seating quite nice.",

The problems came in the morning when the breakfast did not arrive to our room as they had missed our breakfast door hanger so we asked them and they brought our breakfast, I ordered eggs royale and the poached eggs were hard with no hollandaise.

      "text": "We were surprised at how far this pricey hotel fell from our expectations. My wife and I enjoy staying at top-tier hotels and resorts. Admittedly, perhaps 5-stars in the UK is a completely different standard than 5-stars in the U.S. where we are from, but this felt like a mid-range hotel operation that is not worth the cost.\n\nWe had several issues arise during our short Friday-Sunday stay that, in sum, detracted significantly from what we hoped would be a relaxing getaway.\n\nROOM (3/5):\n\nThe property includes a main house and a number of smaller houses. In an attempt to be future-leaning, the rooms are equipped with Google Home devices instead of phones. Unfortunately, our device was not working and we were informed by the staff it was unable to be repaired. This was our only connection to the front desk, so when we needed anything we would have to walk outside in the cold and/or rain to make the request then walk back.\n\nOur room was nicely renovated, with a very comfortable bed and bedding, deep tub and fine shower. Odd things malfunctioned: the towels are hung on a warming towel rack which did not work. I was also disappointed that despite the Smart TVs in the room, they do not allow for casting from a device so you can stream your own shows.\n\nWe wished the room could have been cleaner. Nothing horrible, but there were cobwebs dangling from the ceiling in both the bedroom and bathroom and the walls quite dirty. I would also recommend management install USB-compatible outlets for the benefit of international travelers.\n\nSERVICE (1.5/5):\n\nService is what makes all the difference in a resort setting because you’re stuck on the property. Despite the costly ₤450/night stay, we found service lacking. Let’s get past me having to take my own bags to my room as I’m not above some exercise.\n\nWe ordered room service once using the QR Code in our room - again, admirable attempt to leverage technology, but execution was frustrating. After about 45 minutes waiting, we asked the staff if our food was on the way, and apparently the QR Code in our room sent the staff to the wrong room. They delivered our food after we inquired and straightened things out, but the ice cream was in a puddle and hot items were cold. A very disappointing ₤70 meal where we discarded half of it.\n\nThe room service mentioned above was ordered Friday evening, but the trays and dishes were still outside our door when we checked out two days later on Sunday morning! No one had come by our room once during our stay. On Saturday we informed the front desk our trays hadn’t been collected and I was actually shocked that on Sunday it still hadn’t been done. Completely disgusting to leave old food to rot in a hallway for two days.\n\nWe requested luggage racks so that our suitcases wouldn’t have to be sprawled on the floor and we were told they didn’t own any. This might be the first hotel we've ever stayed at that didn't own luggage racks... We also requested additional coat hangers be delivered to our room which never arrived.\n\nWalking through the grounds, you can’t help but notice dozens of rat traps prominently featured throughout the property near every doorway. I wonder if the apparent rat problem has anything to do with the room service food being left out for days at a time?\n\nFOOD (1.5/5):\n\nThe food quality was disappointing. Our first meal was lunch and the cheeseburger was overcooked and incredibly dense, bun stale, and everything on the plate lacked flavor. The person at the table next to us sent his burger back twice; we opted not to make a similar scene. And the table itself was dirty with breadcrumbs everywhere, I swapped the napkin for one next to me because it looked used. Most items we ordered during our stay we did not finish, although the fish and chips was quite decent. Desserts were bad across the board. Rather than looking forward to meals, we were dreading finding something we might eat. We did not dine at the Tudor Pass, but it seems like that’s the only food service this resort cares about. The Estate Grill and bar clearly need some help.",

My feedback I hope is helpful to further tweak and enhance the experience of guests.\n\nI was a little disappointed with some details which I’ve listed out below.\n1. The room was lovely but, we found rubbish left from a previous guest. Only 2 small cartons of uht milk in the room is very tight\n2. Cocktail bar, very slow service, I had to go and ask twice to be served after waiting 15 minutes, it wasn’t busy\n3. The sofa and accompanying chairs in the bar were dirty and need cleaning\n4. When our bar snacks eventually arrived after a 40 minute wait there was no apology. The waiter then dropped half the crackers on the floor, he didn’t replenish them\n5. Dinner was excellent, great service and the food was very good, but breakfast was not great. Again we waiting 20 minutes for someone to come and ask us for our tea order, we also ordered poached eggs, these eventually arrived cold and looked like some sort of aliens lifeform. Breakfast items not replenished. Only baked bean juice in the pot, no pasties. Mushrooms tasted like they had just be dug up, very muddy. A 3/10 for the breakfast im afraid.\n\nGiven the above I didn’t think it was good value for the price we paid for the room. Sorry.",

The scones light, and the cakes were fantastic. The tea menu has become smaller, but there were a couple of types we hadn't had before that we tried. One negative, despite booking in for a specific time, the service was very slow, 45 minutes for food to arrive and 25 minutes for the tea! Don't ask for a coffee, though... the wait was worse. It was great coffee, but my husband was convinced they had to be waiting for the beans to arrive at Heathrow as it took so long to get to our table. Having said that, the staff were pleasant and helpful... just not very speedy.\n\nDisabled access is not clearly signposted and while it must be accessible by law... I'm not sure if I'd used my wheelchair I'd have made it in. There are no disabled parking spaces marked out.",

Came for a Valentine’s Day meal, our coats weren’t taken, our menus were put on the table before we’d even managed to sit down, they’d run out of the set menu starter because of “walk ins” despite us having a booking, no one then bothered to check on us following receiving our main at any stage and we were never offered any drinks top ups. After waving a manager down to clear our table I’d confronted them about the poor service to which the response was “oh really?” with no offer of apology. Ended up having to wave someone down for the bill, again with no apology what so ever, we had to then stand up and walk to the front to pay our bill (in a 5 star restaurant?!) to which the manager round the corner started to speak poorly of us and had to be told to be quiet by a waiter as we could hear him! Then met with 2 argumentative managers that said they’d take the service charge off, which is optional anyway?! Extremely disappointed, what a wasted valentines meal!",

However, it was the distribution of the space what bothered me the most. The bathroom was huge, yet there wasn’t a lot of space to place your cosmetics. The mirrors were small and positioned in a way that a tall person would have a hard time staring at them. The worst about the room was that the closet was small, and that one of the doors was not openable because it would hit the night table. This is a fatal design mistake and it made me extremely upset. It was so hard to get things in an out of the closet. Inaceptable for a 5 star hotel. The bed was comfortable\nBreakfast was very nice. However, if you wanted a latte, you had to pay for it.

Staff were friendly and really helpful. The decor is quirky, although it often felt like they're trying *too* hard with it (external sign orientation illegible unless you're standing under it, claustrophobic completely astroturfed lift etc). Our room was tiny, which isn't unexpected given the price and location, but it just wasn't at the level you'd expect for a 4 star hotel. Only one small mirror in the very dimly lit bathroom, too far away from any plug sockets to use an implement like a hairdryer in front of. Dodgy exposed wiring for the LEDs in the shower. Could go on, but overall we still thought the hotel was good value for the area - just could do with a few improvements!",

The staff were kind and helpful (one of the front desk folks even gave us breakfast at 5:00 a.m. while we were waiting for our car to the airport), and we loved our room. It was, unsurprisingly, a little on the small side, and it would have been helpful to have had more storage space for our long-ish stay. That said, the bed was incredibly comfortable (even for my 6'4\" husband), the room was dark and quiet at night, the balcony was pleasant, and the bathroom was wonderful. I'm going to miss that bathroom for a while--a deep tub with a seemingly never-ending supply of hot water, great water pressure in the rainfall shower, and I think the floors were even heated. And of course, the art makes this place extra-special. Location is excellent--nearby access to the Underground, easy walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall and museums, and a number of good restaurants within a stone's throw. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.",

Better than a Travelodge in London and you can certainly do better for the costs involved.

I assume that the irony of an image of a communist revolutionary in a supposed 5 star hotel has been lost somewhere...\nAnyway the hotel itself is a quirky little place full of artistic flair. My room was a little on the small side and the foot or so space either side of the extremely comfortable bed made access to the wardrobe very difficult. They gave me two bottles of mineral water each day plus chocolates, biscuits and crisps which was a nice touch. Unfortunately there was no fridge. The room was very well serviced but strangely half a pack of gum had been left on the safe.\nSomewhere to hang your jacket would be good and there's ample space behind the door.\nThe shower was hugely powerful and the bathroom was spotless with high quality toiletries.\nI very much enjoyed breakfast. Well worth a visit. All the staff that I encountered were first class.",

The only downfall to be was using stays to actually get to your room but I do believe that's typical once again for the country. My room has a jacuzzi inside with a TV and unique sound speakers, well lit, shower wit multiple points of splash, rainfall, mist, and handheld sprayer. It's expensive but fit a special occasion, worthy. The staff is helpful even with recommending local restaurants and there are many eateries ask within walking distance. The museum is also about a 5 min walk but it wasn't easy leaving the room. My a/c writhed fine in the room no issues. It's definitely bin and stay here again.",

Of course the hotel can’t control the neighbouring property occupants, but I explained the situation to the night manager, who came in to the room, heard the noise and told me there was nothing he could do as he didn’t have any other rooms. This meant the only option left was to book another hotel and move across London at midnight. The night manager confirmed I would receive a full refund that would take 3-4 days to go through. After a week, I still hadn’t received that. I followed up to receive a reply from Sarah, the general manager telling me that the night manager had not offered me a refund (lie) and she instead offered me a £30 voucher towards another stay at the hotel from my initial £300 booking as a “goodwill gesture”. Are you actually serious?\n\nThey will undoubtedly refute these claims as they have proven themselves to be consistently dishonest.\n\nI don’t like leaving negative reviews, in fact this is the only negative review I’ve ever left - but I felt I should warn others about this situation.\n\nDo not trust them.",

Bed and pillows so comfortable I had the best nights sleep in months, no alcohol involved either just pure comfort. The shower was fantastic, heat of room to your own taste easy to use. Very clean. The best hotel I have stayed in. We will be back. I did not want to leave. Great access to London, lovely little market shop round corner beautiful and can recommend Rocca Italian restaurant 5 min walk away, fresh pasta, great staff. Best hotel experience ever.

The first issue occurred when I went to check in. I asked for some assistance with my bags as I didn't think I could carry them to my room. The manager, at the time I didn't know this is who they were, told me to help myself as they \"don't get paid enough\".  One of the workers, I don't want to expose who as it could get them in trouble, complained of a similar issue and it made me wonder where my hard earned money was going. On top of that, my room had a mouse problem and they just put down one of those sticky mouse traps and said I'd probably attracted them with my room service. That was my last straw and I ended up having to leave early and find new lodgings. Anything is better than here.",

They had plugs sockets for European chargers/electronics which was a nice touch and I had a good nights sleep.\nThe  issue was with the pub associated with the hotel called the Jugged Hare, the attitude of the staff there was terrible. I had got to the hotel and once I was  in my room it clearly has a card in the room saying food is served until 10:00 (as you can see from the picture uploaded). I was in the Jugged hare at 21:35 and they told me that they weren't serving any more and the kitchen was shut. Fine, I ordered a quick drink, confirmed with them that the pub shut at 23:00 and went to the Tesco up the road and got a sandwich. I got back to the bar 22:35/22:40 went to order a drink and I was told the bar was now closed and they would not serve me despite it being very quiet and I could easily have got a drink and finished it before closing time. I don't know any pub that calls last orders so far before closing. I don't really think you can call yourself a 5* hotel if you can't even feed your guests and get them a drink during the times of the day you say you will.",

The state of the rooms do not justify the price tag.\nIn my room, the air conditioning did not work. Or if it did, then it made very little difference to the temperature in the room. The bed was also so soft that I woke after one night of sleeping with pain in the back. Having gone through the day with pain, I thought I would sleep it off. Little did I know that a white night was waiting for me. I tried all the tricks in the book to make myself fall asleep only to give up around 1.00 am and I went down the reception of Barbican rooms to ask for painkillers. The guard/receptionist did not have so he called the main reception, but they did not have any as well. The amount of effort they put in was minimal, even though I made it clear that my back pain is caused by the bed. I ended up walking around London trying to find painkillers without any instructions from the receptionist. I can navigate myself, but given that the hotel prides itself as a 4 star hotel, the service is really missing.\n\nFrom my colleagues, I’ve heard the following:\n* one bathroom had broken tiles and the shower head was ducktaped. The tv was not working and the air conditioning was just as faulty as mine.\n* another colleague’s tv set would inly show a single channel which had a wimbledon match from 20 years ago\n* another colleague could not use the usb charger from the room because it was faulty\n\nAll in all, I can only recommend people to stay away from this hotel.",

No es un hotel de 4 estrellas. 3 con suerte.\n\nEl primer día llegué sola y el que me atendió me dice que me ofrecía una habitación “mejor” a la que tenía reservada sin costo adicional, si le dejaba un comentario con su nombre en TripAdvisor. Le agradecí el gesto. Cuando llegué a la habitación, efectivamente era grande pero estaba en el primer piso, frente al acceso del bar, por lo que sentí el movimiento de las personas que entraban y salían durante toda la noche. Además,  la habitación daba a la calle. El olor a humedad era muy fuerte y toda la ropa de cama y cortinas tenías manchas, y/o en mal estado. Al otro día, ya había llegado mi esposo, por lo que pedí que nos cambiaran de habitación y si bien la ubicación mejoró, me di cuenta que el estado de TODO es PÉSIMO. Este debe ser un hotel que se construyó a inicios del 2000 y, desde ahí, no han renovado ni mantenido correctamente nada, salvo algunos espacios comunes. Todo manchado, los muebles saltados, la ducha en el baño no funcionaba bien y, la guinda de la torta, el olor de los ascensores. Algo se había podrido (ya que lo usan para la comida del bar) y el olor era para vomitar.\n\nJamás volvería. Un asco.",

I thanked him for the gesture. When I got to the room, it was indeed large but it was on the first floor, facing the access to the bar, so I felt the movement of people coming and going throughout the night. Also, the room faced the street. The musty smell was very strong and all the bedding and curtains were stained and/or in poor condition. The next day, my husband had already arrived, so I asked to change our room and although the location improved, I realized that the state of EVERYTHING is TERRIBLE. This must be a hotel that was built in the early 2000s and since then nothing has been properly renovated or maintained except for some common spaces. Everything stained, the furniture jumped, the shower in the bathroom did not work well and, the icing on the cake, the smell of the elevators. Something had rotted (since they use it for bar food) and the smell was to throw up.\n\nI would never go back. disgusting",

I’d have liked a folder in the room with information about the facilities, and housekeeping didn’t show up until after 4 (perhaps with Mr Ciprian’s encouragement?) by which time I’d straightened up the room and washed the teacups myself, but we were generally quite satisfied with our stay.\nI’ll add that we’d booked online at the Barbican Rooms (which are across the street from the Brewery), and I was disappointed that we couldn’t book at the Brewery, but when we checked in we were pleasantly surprised to be given a room at the Brewery. Seemed to be a drunken wedding party at the Rooms across the way but with double windows shut it was quite quiet. I would be delighted to be able to return to this charming hotel.",

We were put in a different room than the one we booked and when we complained they moved us to a room that didn't seem to get cleaned since the 80s. Broken window, letting street noise in, fire alarm going on for no reason several times in a row preventing me from sleeping. When I complained at the reception desk, I was told that this fire alarm problem had been going on for a few weeks, that there wasn't much they could do, but that during the night it would stop (!!!) We were exhausted before the trip even started. With the exception of one polite employee (new, apparently started two weeks ago) all the employees extremely arrogant and rude. As if they were doing us a favor and not their job. We even had to listen a concierge making an extremely racist comment about how the heat wave in London was Morocco's fault and that \"they could have this horrible weather, we (English) don't want it!\". I asked for an plug adapter as the only plug close to the bed did not fit my CPAP machine, and even though I had borrowed an adapter during the afternoon, now the concierge was saying they did not have such a loaner and suggested I should have bought one earlier. Because of the deafening fire alarm going on for no reason, I also asked for earplugs, and the concierge's response was to say that no, I would not need those because, as they had mentioned before, at night the alarm should stop and turned away. I will definitely never go back to this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone. Any Ibis can be better than this supposedly 5 star, full of staff with no professionalism.",

The bathroom especially was so poor. Peeling sinks and handles, mould all around shower, no power to wash properly in shower. We asked for more than 1 towel and if someome could please change bedding after night one and was told by the house keeping they speak no English and was rudely passed of.. we were so disappointed and quite frankly disgusted with how bad and unclean room was we booked travel lodge and didn't stay for the second night. They wouldn't pay us back for the second night we didn't use room and only offered 20% to say sorry that wee didn't have a nice clean 5* stay so basically all our money was used on 1 uncomfortable night. Thankfully travel lodge has normal showers and clean rooms and bedding. I do not recommend anyone spend their money at this establishment. Spend your hard earned money somewhere that actually is 5* and enjoy that actual 5*star experience. Wee will be posting pictures and videos on trip advisor. Terrible experience",

I booked a studio room as I need to work and I wanted to be comfortable. It was 23 pm and I was moving around with my bag changing rooms (Never the studio I booked) They said someone will pick me up to my new room, never happened. I have to the reception because I was completely ignored.\n\nThe bathroom is broken and they said someone will come and again NO ONE CAME EVER! :(  The rooms are old and run down.\n\nNever an apology, and they gave me an attitude.\nRun somewhere else if you can.\n\nI'm dreading staying here 2 more nights.",

I was later escorted to a dingy looking superior room, which looked run down and away from the other rooms. It was extremely cold, with the heater not working and the hot water not working either. I requested for it to be fixed because it was freezing (also considering it was going to snow that evening, how cold it was) or to be moved to another room but they did nothing. I was stuck with this terrible room. I then in the morning tried to fix the payment issue to which I was implied to be a liar and spoken to in the most disrespectful manner.\n\nI would compare the room quality to easyHotel (no disrespect to easyHotel) but with a tad bit of luxury, at least with easyHotel you know what you paid for.

      "textTranslated": "The hotel has a good experience regardless of its appearance, interior or location, but don't trust the official booking website, because I paid twice the price for the accommodation experience.\nAbout a month before the accommodation experience, I first used my membership to make a non-refundable reservation for one night without breakfast through the official system. After a few minutes, I felt that a five-star hotel should include a hotel breakfast. According to the reservation message, if There will be no charge for cancellation before 23:59 local time on the day of booking. Therefore, I canceled the first order and immediately placed a second order including breakfast on the same day, so I only received the second order in my mailbox. After confirming the order message, I naturally understood that the first order could be canceled immediately after being established for a short period of time. Therefore, I did not receive an email indicating the success of the reservation or the cancellation. Subsequently, I only received a second order notification asking if I wanted to join. Personal calendar. However, a few days before my stay, I received the welcome letters for my first and second orders and reported this situation to the customer service staff. They said they would reply to me in three working days to deal with this situation. When I checked in, the management had not yet responded, so the front desk staff backed up my conversation with the customer service. Then the day after I checked out, I received a cancellation letter for the first order, but did not receive a refund, so I asked the hotel , and what I got later was that it was a non-refundable order, so it could not be refunded. What I would like to respond to is that in fact, the hotel's cancellation policy before midnight on the first day does not require payment. This service may be a login problem on the system. Furthermore, if it is confirmed that refunds cannot be made, can we inform you while the room is still available instead of waiting for accommodation? After the time passed, I informed the management that the refund could not be made. In this way, I did not even have the opportunity to transfer or give it to a friend. The accommodation was directly canceled and the hotel received the money directly.",

The staff service left much to be desired, however. As an example, on our last day we asked for our luggage to be held for a few hours, an otherwise common request than much lesser establishment offer by default. The front desk at first said \"there is no space.\" (This is a gigantic hotel with whole empty floors.) Then that holding our bags would be a \"security issue.\" (A security issue which would magically go away if we had an upcoming reservation and we were planning to return.) Even when we politely explained that we would miss our train if we had to find alternative luggage storage, as indeed we did miss our train, the hotel remained inflexible. This profound lack of hospitality renders this no longer the lovely five-star hotel I had in my memories. (We had stayed there several times before.) I will be looking for establishments in which thousands of pounds actually translate to high-quality hospitality in the future.",

The hotel's location gives easy access to travel anywhere in London and boarding Eurostar. You can walk across the street to King Cross station and walk 7–10 minutes to Euston station. As well as very convenient access to the underground.\nThe Hotel building is beautiful. The room was nice and spacious; however, the room was not well kept. The window curtains, the chaise lounge chair and the bed pillows were stained and dirty (the sheets and pillowcase were clean, but the pillow itself was not). I advised the front desk on the first day I arrived there was mold in the shower wall however it appeared that someone made a mere attempt to clean it off by just wiping the shower wall because it did not remove the mold. The mold from the shower wall was fully cleaned off one day before I checked out. I also ended up with a rash in my neck because I fell asleep hugging a pillow and without knowing during my sleep the pillowcase slipped off. This resulted in an big ugly and painful rash on my neck. I ended up going to the pharmacy to get ointment cream for the severe rash that lasted until the end of my UK trip: Sept 24th. The room needs a full deep cleansing because it ruined my experience in London, and I do not wish this upon anyone else. Especially for the price of the stay; Sept 12 629.00, Sept 13 589.00, Sept 14 629.00, Sept 15 409.00 and Sept 16 409.00\n- Carolina Aguilar",

Rooms was spacious and well equipped. However other than when booking in, the staff were aloof, and not one of them smiled. Service is poor and slow. Not what you would expect for 5star accommodations. Also the food was overpriced and again quite a limited menu for a 5star hotel. The same with the drinks, far overpriced. But what really caused the low score was the staff. Must do better here.",

He even climbed the stairs with us and told us about the building's history. Was going to give 4 stars but Antony's hospitality easily makes it 5⭐s.\n\nThe room is pretty good.

The most impressive feature of the room was the ceiling hight, incredible!\nI prefer a stand up shower to the shower in a bath tub that this room had, but it wasn’t really an issue.\n\nBreakfast was lovely, as were the drinks and nibbles provided in the club lounge.\n\nExploring the hotel was incredible and I will be back to dine in the Grand Midland dining room when I can!\n\nSuper easy access to the tube to get around the city and some nice pubs within a short walk.\nBottle of wine and macaroons to recognise Marriott gold membership was a nice touch.\n\nSadly they let me check out, I was hoping they would force me to stay another night!

I had 5 bad issues and the worst took me a whole afternoon to sort out. I had a package delivered to the hotel and the were 100 % sura it didn’t arrive. After half a day they finally found it ! They still haven’t made any apologies. This was just one of many issues for example I booked and got confirmed a double room but got a twin room\nEmbarrassing experience",

      "text": "Horrendous.  The refurbishment following their sale to Iconic Luxury Hotels has removed every ounce of charm and character this hotel (formerly the Draycott) used to have.\nWhat is worse, the service is beyond terrible.  Where to start? No tea or coffee (or anything) served after 10am.  No porridge served at breakfast (in an Iconic luxury hotel?).  The fire alarm goes off and nobody knows where to turn it off for over 15 minutes while the guests wait on the street.\nThe phone in the room does not work for the entire 4 day stay, forcing a couple in their 80s to walk down 3 steep flights of stairs every time they need something.\nThe \"garden suite\" has no window (but is priced palatially).\nAnd so it goes on.  Having been loyal guests of the Draycott for over 10 years we are going to have to find another place to stay in London.\nThis was a once-in-a-lifetime disaster!",

The staff here were so friendly and helpful, we don't travel light and have our 2yo daughter with us on a world trip, so from the moment we arrived on the door step the staff took our very heavy bags straight up to our room. As others have mentioned the hotel is under new management and undergoing some renovations initially we were a little worried reading this, however we could not have been happier with our stay, we had an amazing room, it was very quiet and peaceful, everything worked well and even the hot water was instant! The beds were very comfortable and the staff kept the room well appointed and amenities stocked up. We ordered in some Thai food and the staff brought up plates and cutlery along with the delivery, they certainly went the extra mile to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. We certainly will stay here again when we next travel the world in 12 to 24 months. Thank you!",

      "text": "I'm extremely sad and disappointed with the management of The Draycott. My family and I have been staying at The Draycott for over 25 years (at least one trip per year) beginning when my two daughters were kids (and now adults). Every experience was always perfect, with afternoon tea, an evening glass of champagne and, of course, hot chocolate in the late evening. The staff has been and still is terrific. They watched our kids grow up! The Draycott has been our \"home away from home\" in London.\n\nWe are booked to stay in mid-February, a reservation I made last August.Two days ago I received an email informing me that the hotel had been sold to the owners of 11 Cadogan Gardens Hotel around the corner and that the hotel:\n\"...........will begin a series of refurbishments on the 3rd January 2023 [note: I received this email after 3/1].The hotel will be operating with altered facilities and services to normal while the works are undertaken.  Houses 26 and 24 will be closed, meaning you will need to use the entrance of House 22 to enter/exit the premises. There will be a scaffolding in House 22,24 and 26.  The Drawing Room, Library and Dining Room will be closed and the complementary Tea, glass of English Sparkling Wine and Hot Chocolate unavailable.Unfortunately, breakfast will be room service only and limited to a continental offering.\"\n\nIn short, it will be a construction site and they will not be providing the quality services nor have the amenities that have historically defined The Draycott.I asked the reservationist why they had not offered to honor my reservation with comparable rooms at Number 11 (given the common ownership), especially given it's the slow season. I didn't get a satisfactory response. I asked that the manager, who's been with the hotel a long time and knows we are a longstanding and regular hotel guest, call me to discuss. I have not heard back from anyone.\n\nI would think the owners of Number 11 would be interested in keeping longstanding guests of The Draycott and I'm pretty sure they would be surprised that no one has followed up with me.\n\nSadly, we will likely cancel our reservation at The Draycott and look for a new \"home away from home\" in London.",

The drawing room where it was served was lovely, the gentleman attending to us was fab and the food was lovely and very generous however the drawing room leads onto a garden and there was some rather large issue with a family staying there that made our visit really uncomfortable and stressful. The woman kept running in and out slamming doors and shouting and the it child was doing the same and kept coming to our table and staring at is. It was quite cold and as the room is small it was very disruptive and noisy and the relaxing ambience of afternoon tea was ruined by this. The staff didnt do anything either until we complained and it was too late. It's a shame as it's a lovely place to visit but it was tainted by this family's behaviour.",

We decided to stay in Chelsea as we are looking to move back town in Chelsea and thought a new experience at a boutique hotel would be a nice change from larger hotels like the Mandarin etc...  We had an issue the first night because the heat was not working in our room when I checked in during the afternoon.  Unfortunately the technician was gone for the day. The only complaint is that everyone somewhat avoided my request to change rooms and never addressed that query.  A couple of different people came up to tell me it was in fact cold in the room and did not seem to be working  However, they did come up with space heaters to our suite.   The following day our heat was fixed and the room was warm. The staff are VERY friendly and welcoming. They try to make the hotel fell like a home which it very much did. There are definitely renovations happening and I can see where they are needed.  One thing I will note is this........  they have an area where all of these travel guides and cards are displayed.  I would advise to not have these displayed as they do make things seem a bit on the tacky side.  Having these discretely put in the back office and available for tourists looking to explore is far more appealing.  We shall definitely try staying here again as we house hunt.",

They helped us get tickets for some of our sightseeing, gave great directions and great information. We would love to visit them again soon.

Then he said the room is fully automated so please see the video before using it. I said sure. He again insisted, I had to retort I have home automation at my place back in India.\nThere is no Kettle in the room for you to make tea, if you are tea drinker. You have to ask for one and the person who brings it does not speak English.\n\nThe bathroom is too small and cramped, I hit myself in the head (should not be more than 5 feet, on the towel drying stand on the wall next to the door).  There is no place to keep your luggage (not even a luggage collapsible stool). The photographs are misleading.\nIt is 9 mins walk from Victoria station. Do not get mislead by kilometer distance mentioned, you cannot walk to those places from here - check the time it will take for example Westminster Abbey will take you 20 to 25 mins that is the shortest.\nI booked because my agent recommended it. I have stayed in Radisson Blu Edwardians, Park Plaza's and all of them are way to better.\nIf you are someone who are enamored by Gizmos and have not seen them, go for it and waste your money here. Otherwise lot more good hotels at this price.\n\nClean sheets, clean floors and Nice exterior look (Row houses Victorian style architecture) are the only plus.",

The shower was really great. But the best part of the room was the bed. It's the most comfortable bed I've ever had at a hotel and the massage feature and elevation features were phenomenal after having walked all around London. I wish I could've taken the bed with me to our next hotel. The location was also super convenient because it was close to Victoria Coach Station and Victoria Station. We didn't have to take a single taxi. All in all, I cannot recommend enough; I would not stay at any other hotel in the price range, Eccleston is it.",

There is a beautiful private Eccleston square park just across the street so it was a perfect place to decompress from a busy trip. Belgravia and Sloan square are a quick walk so I found it easy to spend the day just walking the neighborhoods. My room was gorgeous, with many thoughtful design features and a lot of amenities - morning coffee, a beautiful bar, room service not to mention a massage bed, and smart TV with screen mirroring. The bathroom especially was stunning. Check in and check out were so easy, an the staff could not have been more friendly  and ensured I had everything I needed. So glad I found this gem and will definitely be back!",

Es ist kein Platz dafür.  Die wenigen Schränke sind mit Safe, Kühlschrank, Bügelbrett etc. voll. 2 Schubladen und fertig..... mehr hat man nicht.\nDie Klimaanlage funktioniert dafür tadellos,  es gibt keine Schwankungen beim Wasser wenn man duscht......

Soaping is more reminiscent of a contortionist's performance.\nThe highly praised beds are just beds. Comfortable... Yes... but also a bit too narrow for 2 adults. But more bed would also be bad, because the space around the bed is so small that a normal suitcase would block any passage...... yes, suitcase... where to put it? There is no room for it. The few cupboards are full of safes, refrigerators, ironing boards, etc. 2 drawers and you're done... you don't have anything more.\nThe air conditioning works perfectly, there are no fluctuations in the water when you shower... The rooms are actually very quiet...\nYou can book... but if you need more space, you should look around further",

Our September 2023 London research visit brought us to The Marylebone. This handsome property near Bond Street, Mayfair and Soho offered luxurious tranquillity in a popular part of town. With excellent travel connections and a wealth of nearby shopping, dining and entertainment, The Marylebone is perfectly positioned for leisure guests, plus business stays and corporate events.\nThe Marylebone houses a premium collection of 252 bedrooms and suites set across 7 floors. Ours featured a gigantic and extremely comfortable bed, in a room which was well insulated from any outside street noise. Such features as a workspace, safe, smart TV and minibar are a welcome touch for business travellers like us. Luxury toiletries, robes, slippers, and premium technology made our stay even more special. The room was spacious and lavishly decorated to a timeless fashion, ensuring a great sleep and a relaxing stay.\nWe were given a comprehensive tour of the communal areas and event spaces by Stephanie, MICE Sales Manager for The Doyle Collection (to which The Marylebone belongs). We were totally smitten by the décor of the Cocktail Bar, which is inspired by the four seasons of the year. The space fills with natural light during the summer months and offers fireside warmth in winter. The hotel offers an impressive range of meeting rooms and versatile event spaces. A highlight for us was Number Six. This stunning, multi-purpose space has a private ground floor entrance, with its own cloakroom and reception area. The space is bathed in daylight, with mirrored surfaces reflecting the rich colours of the furniture and wooden floor around the room. There’s capacity for up to 250 standing guests, with moveable walls and even a lavish concealed bar which transform the space for a multitude of uses. Other impressive spaces include The Courtyard, an internal terrace featuring a retractable roof and striking fireplace for year-round events, such as private dinners under the light of the stars. The Blue Room, as the name suggests, is vibrantly decorated, and offers configurations to suit events from 8 to 80 guests. Every space we viewed had been furnished and finished with loving attention to detail.\nOur stay included breakfast, which gave us the opportunity to sample one of the best full Irish breakfasts I’ve enjoyed. The food was of excellent quality, and service was warm, friendly, and attentive, giving us confidence that event guests would be well looked after too. The delicious calories offered at the table were well spent at the onsite Third Space luxury health-club and gym. Featuring cutting edge equipment, great spa facilities and an energetic vibe, I can honestly say they were the most impressive hotel fitness facilities I’ve used.\nWith their collection of top tier event spaces, luxuriously comfortable bedrooms, plus the five-star hospitality we enjoyed, we’re delighted to recommend The Marylebone to our clients. To plan your corporate events at this excellent hotel, contact the team at Flavour Venues & Events.",

We booked the hotel through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts collection and found it to be fairly central to everything we needed to do.\n\nUnfortunately, upon arriving in England, my baggage was lost and I was actually told by British Airways that it was stolen. I had a business conference for two days immediately following our arrival, and we were in a panic to begin replacing my suits and other items.\n\nOnce we arrived at the hotel, we went to our assigned hotel room. Frankly, we were not enthralled with the first room we were presented with because it had an odd shape, and we had booked a larger studio suite. The staff accommodated us by showing us other available rooms we could possibly move to, but we needed to go shopping to replace my items.\n\nAdrian, the concierge, had been discussing with my wife where to go to get suits and a tailor. Adrian went so far as to locate a tailor that he knew and had them on standby for me, so no matter what, I could have my suits tailored immediately.\n\nTo make a long story short, we ended up purchasing the suits at the store he recommended and had them tailored immediately so that everything went smoothly with my conference. When we returned to the hotel, the staff had located a room on the seventh floor to move us to. That room was far superior to the others and came at no additional cost.\n\nThat night, we sat at the hotel bar, spoke with the wonderful bartenders from Italy, and finally got to relax and start enjoying our trip.\n\nFrom the front desk staff to Adrian at the concierge, the doorman, and the cleaning staff, our service experience was exceptional. I am very impressed with this hotel and will stay there again on my future trips to London. Thank you, everyone at The Marylebone!",

Didn’t have enough time to try the restaurants and other facilities.\n\nBut Adrian was always nice, and although I’m always in a rush. I can still remember his face, he never hesitate to say hi and have a quick chat.\n\nI would definitely love to stay here again.",

We actually changed rooms b/c the first one was extremely worn and outdated. Second room was nicer, but shower and bathroom were Lilliputian. Shower literally sprayed several streams of water on the sink when on.\n\nGym access, and gym set up, was amazing.\n\nOverall, pretty average to above average. Rooms a 3. Lobby and location 5. Gym 5. Service a 3. Restaurants/bar- 0. Really not a 5 five star hotel and so look elsewhere if that’s what you are expecting.",

Our concierge Alba set us up with two incredible dinners same day for a party of 10 (one w a Michelin chef at one of the hottest new restaurants in the city)\n\nThe bars are just phenomenal- classy, hip, fun with true professional bartenders with flair and a knowledge of mixology.\n\nThe gym is very nice and high end with all equipment, lots of space for plyo, a lot of personal training going on. My family hit it every day as well as pool and steam room.\n\nLocation steps from so many cool restaurants bars cafes and 5 mins to the tube.\n\nBeds are very comfy, room not the largest but big enough and with such great amenities no need to stay in the room!",

      "text": "Me and my partner were attending a private special conference event held by my company at The Marylebone hotel recently.\n\nArrival:\nI pulled up outside in my own personal vehicle, a 13 year old Mondeo but to my pleasant surprise the door staff still treated me like a VIP and carried my bags in for me. Compared to all the other cars in the area I wouldn’t have blamed them for ignoring me or mistaking me for a delivery driver! It was a very pleasant experience and the staff were extremely friendly. They held my bags for me until check in.\n\nParking:\nUnfortunately no parking on site (which is understandable for central London) however they have a discount for a parking garage down the road. This is good, however upon checking the online reviews of the parking garage there is evidence of a lot of car damage (break ins, thefts). I ended up parking my car in Westfield shopping centre for the night as I had been recommended it was very secure and only a 15/20 min tube away from the hotel and also very well priced at £15 a day.\n\nOur bags were brought to our room\n\nAt the night of the special event the staff were very friendly and lively, doing a great job making sure drinks were topped up in the private function. At dinner, me and my partners dietary requests were met perfectly, my partner had the best gluten free bread she’s ever had. She is desperate to know the brand! Dinner was done to a great standard and was very lovely.\n\nChecking out was very easy and they held our bags for the day until we were ready to come back and collect. All a very easy process and the staff once again very helpful.\n\nOverall I had an amazing stay and it was extremely luxury and a true experience for me which I won’t forget. Definitely recommend\nThe room was very spacious, the bathroom was very luxury. I loved that the large television had built in chrome cast which was a great touch, I had tried to cast to TV’s in hotels before with no luck at all so I was ecstatic to have this feature. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The room I had was with a lovely view out onto the street allowing a view of Londoners and especially the night life.",

We chatted about my trip and about our Irish heritage. Upon checking in to my Classic queen room, I found it to be a little small for my preferences and called down to reception who were able to offer me a Deluxe king for a supplement each night. I was shown to room490. Stunning views on to the decorated views of Marylebone through a huge window. A newly renovated room - perfect. I enjoyed breakfast at the hotel, had afternoon drinks in the bar and had a lovely steak dinner in the restaurant. Throughout my whole stay I was treat impeccably. The lovely Stan was such a help and a wonderful lady on reception (whose name escapes me but holds a lovely warm smile). I chose this hotel because I had some surgery on Harley Street and needed to be close by, but J would choose it again in a heartbeat wherever I need to be in London. Such a treat. Thank you again, Emma",

The most important element in any hotel room is the bed . My mattress was superb as were the luxurious down filled pillows. Room service was outstanding, fast, friendly and very professional . ( it had, surprisingly, the best burger that I have ever eaten) .\nThe doormen , concierge and everyone we encountered bent over backwards to be of assistance . It was amazingly consistent throughout our stay .\nThe hotel is located close (one minute walk) to Marleybone high street ( try the outstanding fish restaurant) and the Wallace Collection .\nThere is a cab always outside the hotel door and will whisk you away to wherever you\nwish .\nSo , we stayed for a week and shall definitely be returning.\nCongratulations to the management for running it so seamlessly.",

The heating system wasn’t working in my room on the first day(I thought it would eventually work, but it didn’t) so I went to bed feeling pretty cold. I called the reception the next morning, and they told me that their mechanics were coming. I waited for roughly an hour, which delayed my schedule. I wish the reception had told me approximately how long I would wait. The mechanics guy was very polite and helpful. He asked for my permission to enter the room and assured me that I didn’t break anything. I guess they couldn’t fix the problem so gave me a heater. My room was a little claustrophobic, so I nearly tripped on this really hot heater several times.  Unfortunately, my amenities were not changed the next day, so again I called and asked for them. I waited for 20-30min, but didn’t receive them. When I came home I had a lovely amenity bag though. Just a lot of waiting for things to come, so maybe it’s better to ask how long you would wait.\nI felt that this room was not architected well. There were no plugs for hairdryer in the bathroom, and the toilet paper holder was not in the best place to use, for example.  Quite inconvenient regarding these. Otherwise, pretty nice place :)",

I get it they charge a premium.\nThe service at the club house is impeccable and everything is available in the pro shop. Staff have a satisfying can do attitude though slightly with an arrogance. Nothing is reasonably priced but everything is impeccable. In comparison with other superior golf clubs in the country and Scotland, you pay a premium for round without the views you may enjoy in other courses! Everything is manicured to the highest standard and catered for a great experience. Driving range has everything you need. Overall superb course ( less the views) and service (at a premium) and a great experience all round. My only let down was that they don’t have a hotel van service to bring people without cars to the near by train station! Almost impossible to get any Ubers unless you pay their incredible high arranged cab service !\nFor the course, I highly recommend a round.",

Just make sure you keep all your belongings in a safe and do not leave anything behind as you’d never see it again!\nP.S. the lady at breakfast was kind of rude too saying I haven’t filled my plate enough and I should go for more as it’s a free buffet!\nIt was said in a sarcastic way and I think she should have kept her opinion to herself!",

The fundamental basis of a hotel stay (of this price point where everything should be perfect) is the quality and privacy of the room- this was not met. In addition, they had essentially put 2 twin beds together rather than having a king which also ruined the experience. A real shame to what would have been a great weekend treat. Very disappointing.

It has nice parts and it has damaged parts. I attach a picture for the room.\n\nThe hotel gym is now renovated and pretty great, kudos. The Sequoia Spa is nice and would recommend even if some of the pictures inside are damaged.\n\nTye staff are still a complex bag here and I would say are mostly good. Still there is a tendency for being told \"no.\" or  first \"yes\" then \"No\" and even \"let me check that for you, sure yes.\" then finally back to \"no.\"\n\nThis included asking for a towel at Ralph's beach club and being told \"no, and your order will be £6\"\n\nOr asking for the ft in the morning and being told \"yea of course.\" and never seeing it.\n\nIt's just not great hospitality. Obviously hospitality is hard because people expect great at all times but I would just hope that the staff are being paid well enough to feel they should. And for the prices to go to the hotel there is money for it.\n\nHowever shoutout to pool attendant who we asked after who tracked two towels  down for us and brought them himself. You should be promoted but it would be at the cost of losing one of the only staff that went above and beyond.\n\nWe ate at Madhu’s at The Grove, was great. Food is tasty, some dishes really so and servers are attentive.\n\n\"Ralph's beach\" is part of the property, promptly closes at 6 and is a pit of screaming children, still no table service and a better selection of food or drinks.\n\nIn the main garden at night the fire pit is done well and it's a beautiful grounds. The landscaping has been done great.\n\nThe breakfast was very average especially the chicken sausage is tasteless and a bit \"mystery meat\" for me.\n\nOverall a a hotel it's probably a 4.5.\nOverall experience is 3.4\n\nBut I think it's going in the right direction!\n\nCaptions to photos\n1)Hallway ceiling water pot (this is now gone)\n2) Views from room bay window\n3) \"balcony\" from deluxe west wing sweet.\n4) general room wear",

Additionally, it is essentially a massive kids club with no peace and quiet aside from the golf courses. Room looked worn out and not worth the price. The food was average as well as very expensive. My partner had also booked an activity, which the hotel forgot about, the instructor did not show up. In my opinion, it is not worth 5 stars and is ridiculously overpriced for what it’s worth. If you’re a family, it’s probably a great place, but not for couples or adults.",

      "text": "This is a tricky review... The Glasshouse Restaurant was packed and buzzing... Great atmosphere.  The venue is superb.  The service was very good with a couple of flaws.  The food was very good... In parts.  This was the buffet dinner with some live cooking stations.  It all just seemed a little forced.... I asked for still water to be brought 3 times... Request ignored.  The grill station was average, especially the herbed salmon and not refilled quickly enough.  The carvery section was average with good beef wellington and average slow roasted lamb.  The Asian section was excellent with great chicken tikka and the pad Thai was excellent too.  Desserts were excellent too.  The tricky bit is the price per head.  For the amount paid, I would expect a higher quality of food, even for a buffet.    The company we were with was brilliant and actually made the meal feel better than it actually was.  I may be wrong... The food seemed that it had been brought in and reheated rather than prepared fresh on the premises, particularly the sushi (obviously not reheated!), the beef wellington...the desserts too.  I apologise if I'm wrong!\n\nAll in all, a good experience and I just feel there's room for improvement.  I have been to hotels with similar offerings and much better quality because you can see it all being prepped and cooked in front of you...\n\nFor me to go again, something would have to change... Probably the price paid...",

The lunch at the Spa was faultless I enjoyed it immensely.  The lunch at the hotel was superb we had the buffet. My daughter is coeliac and our outstanding waiter \"Diana\" I THINK that's how his name is spelt couldn't have done anymore to accommodate her. He helped her choose food at the buffet and made her feel extra special.  He was professional,polite and very kind. He brought her a gluten free birthday cake too which was perfect.  I highly recommended you stay here and/or eat here and have a treatment or spa day.",

The hotel is beautifully kept, the gardens and grounds are stunning, the food at the restaurants is great too. The walled garden is a highlight, the spa and treatment rooms are also excellent. We felt that for the price we paid, that our room was beginning to look a little tired. It was otherwise a big bright room, with big windows and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom and shower were very good, and the bathtub was huge. The view of the garden from the 'garden view' room was an obstructed view which was not made clear at booking. There is a high wall on the balcony that means if you're sitting in the room, you can only see the tops of the trees.\nWe enjoyed our stay enormously and would return",

The breakfast is AMAZING and to die for. A lot of choice and there is something for everybody!  My boyfriend had a nut and seed allergy and the staff was incredibly considered and really paid attention for it.\nThe hotel is easy to get to from the airport. We had a great golf initiator (Sam Miller) who really made the initiation wonderful. The Woodland Hawking acitivity was lovely! If you want and love a personal experience with birds of prey, you really should book this activity. Grant, the owner of the birds of prey, was amazing! A really passionate, kid  and fun person who will tell you anything you want know about his job and the birds. Just amazing experience! We highly recommend it ! There are so much fun things to do outside the hotel that is provide by the hotel in a form of partnership. We also did the feast and foraging experience. It was a magical experience and perfect to end our weekend trip. We learned new things about plants in nature and the food was incredible. As co-organiser of our trip I can definatly say that The Grove and all the activities it offers is and are really worthy of visiting this hotel! We had a wonderfull time here and we would definatly go back there! Incredible hotel and experience! We really recommend it for everybody who want a peacefull and fun get away with family (and or friends)! (Ps: dogs are welcome to!)",

      "text": "Firstly I want to highlight that if it wasn’t for the absolutely outstanding, kind caring customer service of the duty manager Debbie Austin-Morgan I think I would have given this hotel a 1 star rating.\n\nWe stayed for 2 nights in the heatwave in June. The experience didn’t start well as the staff at reception seemed miserable and actually sighed at me when we went to check in! The young man behind the counter seemed terrified, awkward and obviously didn’t know what he was doing. He made no eye contact and kept walking to his colleague. When tried to clarify that breakfast was included he said he didn’t know and he advised to go to the glass house and ask then! We asked were the glass house was and he nodded to his left and said ‘over there’! It was not the best start.\n\nWe got to our room, which was boiling hot. We put the air con on but didn’t seem to make a difference but as we were off to Harry Potter we decided to leave it on and hopefully to come back to\na cool room. We got back to the room approximately 8pm and it was like an oven! We called reception and they sent the engineer to look at the aircon. He stated it was not working and he would let the duty manager.\n\nThis is where we met Debbie. She showed us to two other rooms, however one of the rooms the electricity wasn’t working so we went to the second room.\nAgain it was very very hot but the air con was set. We also had some windows to open to get an initial breeze. We had room service and alcohol from the free mini bar.\n2:30 am. So hot. The air con again was not working. We didn’t sleep well. We had the windows opened but at 6am the gardners started using power tools so no sleep!\n\nWe went down for breakfast and on the way we were going to speak to reception but they seemed very busy so went to breakfast. We were sat and then it took 10 mins for anyone to come explain the breakfast or offer tea and coffee. The breakfast was very lovely though.\nWe went to speak to reception after breakfast and the member of staff eye rolled at me and said she would ask the maintenance department to look whilst we were out for the day.\nOur day out was ruined to be honest as we were so tired and this so far has not been the relaxing luxurious stay we expected.\nOn our return about 4pm the staff on reception told us that ‘you hadn’t set the air con properly so we set it’. I said ‘I did set it. It didn’t work. I am aware how to set an air con’. All I got was a rude smirk and advised to call back if any other issues.\n\nGuess what?? Yes, the room was an oven. I burst into tears. My husband went back to reception and again maintenance came up and after 3 hours, where told the air con was not working and hadn’t ever worked - newly refurbished room.\nDebbie then appeared again. I was very upset. We then, with all our luggage, me with wet hair in a dressing gown then walked to the other side of the hotel to a beautiful freezing cold suite.\nDebbie then offered to refund the previous night and put a bottle of prossecco on our table at dinner along with a late check out.\n\nThe glass house was lovely and our table waiter was very lovely and apart from Debbie the only person who was polite and kind to us.\n\nWe were so tired that we took advantage of the late check out and missed our Windsor castle tour.\n\nIn the end the one night was lovely with a lovely room, lovely food a nice member of staff.\n\nBut am very shocked that this is a 5 star hotel - the service, attitude of the staff, air con maintenance were so below the standards expected.\n\nDebbie Austin -Morgan though really should be paid extra and asked to give lessons about kind, compassionate customer service to everyone but mostly to the reception staff.",

Wish I could give it less than 1/5.\nWorst stay of my life, we booked the Emperor suite to celebrate our wedding and stay for two nights. The Emperor suite was disgusting, the ceiling was riddled with mould and dust and it was very obvious where they had just (badly) painted over it. My wife's asthma was triggered by the mould and has had to start using heavy medication due to this. I told the staff and they offered to move rooms, the next 2 rooms were full of mould again. The 4th room did not have any visible mould. Staff were very unhelpful and made it seem like I was the problem for complaining about mould. I raised a complaint to management on 2nd September and no response still, we are now 13th October. They do not care about the conditions of their rooms. They do not care about you as a client or your stay. Do not spend your hard earned money on low quality fake prestige, £400 something a room, not even worth £40.\n\nI cannot stress how awful the conditions are in this hotel. All of my images are time stamped and geotagged. This was in August 2023. I've given them a chance to respond but they have not even acknowledged a single email or call.\n\nPlease for your own health and mental well being, do not stay here under any circumstances!\n\nAwful hotel, terrible service and an all round cheap and tacky experience.\n\nI have video as well but can't upload them on google reviews. (Edited review on same day to update cost of room and the dates mentioned above)",

We called up twice to be told their was no wash bag found, I know this not to be true the contents of the bag were very expensive. How dare you excuse this of being a fake review when you must have on record us calling up, if you do not it proves the incompetence and untrustworthiness of your staff. I don’t care if other people have written good reviews you made our honeymoon night awful, the service was terrible and your hotel have stolen hundreds of £s worth of skincare.

Firstly we went to the restaurant one evening as we only got back late and had some dinner, but the staff were more focused on cleaning down and rushing us out rather than actually looking after us, I will give a fair assessment of the situation, it was late (21:45) however being rushed is also not ideal, my advice would be just don't take the reservation if you aren't prepared to provide the service, it felt very rushed, to the extent they were locking the doors as we were eating, the meals served were like Microwaved meals... but no questions were asked when the waitress came over and both plates were still full, the most frustrating thing was she had the card machine before even clearing the table, clearly wanting us to leave.. it just felt very rushed for an overpriced shoddy meal.\n\nThis bad taste was then followed the next day by an aggressive bar man when I went to get two coffees. I ordered, a gentlemen then asked me have I been serve, to which I explained the bar man had taken my order. He then came over telling me to wait and that he's serving somebody, very agressive, he clearly realised he was in the wrong as he gave me the coffees for free once I asked who he's speaking too, this combined with the previous evening left a bad taste on the hospitality side of things to which I'd go as far as saying to avoid the restaurant.\n\nOn two occasions we returned later on, to which 2 of the staff members are just sat around in the café bit in the dark, not even an acknowledgment at any point.\n\nwe opened the drawers to the mini fridge to make a coffee this morning, to which the dirty cups were placed in there from the day before.\n\nTo add to the service above, We were then further charged for parking today on check out which again was annoying as the lady who checked us in on Friday clearly stated the parking was included on the Monday aswell when we paid for that! We just paid today as we couldn't be bothered arguing but just both agreed it's an experience we won't be revisiting, especially with the other 5* hotels charging the same price.\n\nThe manager today came out with some belongings that were left behind, to which I'd say it's an honest run hotel, just rated far too highly for the level of service they provide.\n\nIf somebody would like to contact me to discuss this further, I am happy with that 👍",

A small table to eat at would be a great addition to the rooms for in room dining.\nOverall a nice stay, all our staff interactions were fine and professional.\nGym was adequate and complimentary.",

      "text": "Most rude disgusting malicious hotel I’ve ever booked. The manager called me when I had important meeting to discuss a breakfast issue I stated I was in a meeting and can’t discuss details I can speak on upon arrival. They kept calling all week for inappropriate questions about things we could of spoke about when I arrived. She didn’t like the fact I said to her that she had a very rude tone and wouldn’t get off my phone despite me saying I’m at work. She then made a offensive comment and hung up. Her name is Kuman Dillsa and claimed to be the only manager available. I told her I was going to complain about her inappropriate behaviour and constantly calling to tell me jacuzzi wasn’t working and things I didn’t really feel were important because I made clear I didn’t want to use the jacuzzi. She then went behind my back and cancelled my booking and lied writing taps wasn’t working. I called back to ask her why she did that and she lied and said she didn’t. It wasn’t only until I stated my calls are recorded for work purposes she confesses. She didn’t realise I had 2 bookings as my parents were checking in day after me and she only cancelled one despite both being under my name. This was a obvious move to be malicious because I told her she’s calling me inappropriate hours of work when I asked them day before to not contact me until arrival. They are all Asian/Indian and not very diverse. She confidently said go and make a complaint as she knows the head office are also Asian clearly she wasn’t concerned. I also sent 2 emails regarding her behaviour and I’ve still had no response. Luckily I booked into another hotel which was way better than this one and I’m glad she saved me £1500 of my money. I also had 4 spa treatments booked at £90 which they also lost the money due to a managers foul attitude. I’ve never dealt with such unprofessionalism and when I told her I would make sure I post the call on social media so people could see how they treat paying customers she acted like she didn’t speak English. She wanted to inconvenience me but leave my parents booking? Her behaviour was erratic and absurd. Extremely unstable and her spiteful move to cancel one booking making a mistake to lie and leave the other as she didn’t notice o had 2 clearly shows this. I don’t recommend this hotel at all and the are unprofessional and have nobody to complain to if there is a issue.",

We indulged in the spa and found it was designed very nicely, the Sauna, steam room, cold pool and hot tub were all very good. I do wish there was more of these instead of one of each. The rooms were gorgeous and spacious, the large windows offered us a great view of the Thames. the staff also decorated our bed in rose petals which was very nice.\n\nThe Dinner was also very nice, we found that it was decently cheap for a 5 star hotel, but it came quick and tasted good, especially the cheesecake severed for desert. What we did find during our dining experience was that a lot of the staff stood around a lot, which we can understand as at the time it wasn't very busy. But one stood on the stairs on his phone which was next to us, and that made us slightly uncomfortable, but nothing that dwells on us. Everything else was perfect and a lovely gateway for our anniversary. I would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone who is considering going here.",

Tacky, unstructured, full of faux flowers in vases..on wall, on tables, on floors) 4 silver prancing dolphins adorn the front entrance set on a rug. There are a lot of rugs. Everywhere.  It's as though a lot of the decorations were purchased on a market stall? There is no coherence or theme. Unless the theme is living in a nightmare David Lynch film set.\nRooms were clean. Bizarre TV hanging from a metal pole in the ceiling? Why? It was at head height and protruded from wall, hit it a few times as the gap between the bed and wall was quite small.\nLeaking shower and taps. Lose more points. The cot bed was horrible.  A mattress about 3 inches thick, I have backache today. All for £320 a night. Absolute rip off. There is a travel lodge 5 mins away  choose wisely, do not book to stay here. Its a very poor example of a 4 star hotel.",

My family members thought the stay was so so. The decor is dated, with plastic tacky banners put up and chairs and equipment stored in the corridor. Reception area is where the 80s Versacesque abomination. In addition, during the last night there was a technical issue setting off the inbuilt, badly covered tvs in the room and bathroom, causing a lot of noise around midnight. Someone came to look at it and brought in another guy to try and find the source and silence it. It then happened again around 3am. Same story again, however this time the 2 said staff members were fighting in the corridor basically making it impossible for my family to rest. Upon check out, my brother complained at reception about the incident and was given compensation for the night. At no point was mentioned that the deposit was included in the compensation given back to the guests and not to me as the cardholder. I spoke to the hotel, as I am the card holder for the booking and the deposit, but am not being given my deposit back. AVOID AT ALL COST!",

The ONLY good thing about the room was the excellent water pressure in the shower.\nTorn carpet, warm fridge, horrible bed, death trap getting in and out of the shower, electric plugs in bathroom did not fit the hairdryer, several of the outlets in the room were dead and the lighting in both the bathroom and the room was worse than poor.\nNow, onto the food.\nWe had the \"breakfast included \" plan. Big mistake.  The \"buffet \" consists of eggs, bacon, possibly eggs (hard to tell), mushrooms, some sort of potatoes and beans that look like they were leftovers from the day before.  That's why I decided to order from the menu.  Also a mistake.  The eggs Benedict consisted of an English muffin that was \"toasted \" until it tasted stale, over poached eggs on stringy prosciutto topped with some sort of paste.\nAfter expressing our disappointment in everything the management offered a bottle of prosecco and the opportunity to change rooms. (We were there for 11nights). We turned this down and were basically ignored for the rest of our stay. This hotel is very tired, broken windows, plastic flowers (in vases of dirty water) and some deep cleaning in all areas is needed.\nAlmost forgot about the fire alarm going off at 1:30am. When asked the next morning, the staff actually said \"what alarm?\" It must have rung for at least 5min. Other guests were also leaving their rooms and no one from the hotel showed any concern or advised us on what was going on.\nAll in all my best advice is:\nSTAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!",

Hotel has a kind of agreement with a local taxi driver/company that costed us 105 GBP to go from the hotel to Heathrow airport. They initially said 100 GBP but I didn´t want to discuss about it. We were supposed to arrive to Terminal 5 but the taxi driver finally left us in Terminal 4 without telling us. We had to take 2 additional trains to arrive to our initial destiny. We almost lost our plane after paying such a considerable amount. I really consider should manage much better this type of extras that could have ruined completely our stay in London.",

      "text": "I had the pleasure of staying at Tower Suites by Blue Orchid for an extended period of one month and four days (Sept-October 2023). From the moment we arrived, it was evident that the staff at Tower Suites prioritized guest satisfaction going above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic experience throughout our stay.\n\nInitially, we had booked an Airbnb for our accommodation after the first few days we were here. However, upon realizing that it did not meet our standards, we made the decision to return to Tower Suites. The front office team leader, Vi, not only welcomed us back but also personally ensured that our entire month-long stay felt like a true home away from home.\n\nOne aspect of our stay that required special attention was our bedding preference. We had requested two single beds instead of a king-sized bed and a rollaway mattress. The front duty manager, Mr. Trevor, and the housekeeping team member, Mr. Jishnu, tirelessly searched the entire hotel to fulfill our request. Their dedication and commitment to guest satisfaction were truly commendable.\n\nThe culinary experience at Tower Suites was nothing short of exceptional. Mr. Boris, in charge of breakfast, consistently delivered a perfect start to our day. We also had the pleasure of dining at the hotel's restaurant, where Mr. Mohammad, the supervisor, ensured that every dish catered to our taste buds. The quality of the food and the impeccable service left a lasting impression on us.\n\nThroughout our stay, the concierges, Mr. Yasen, Diogo, Alex were warm, kind and always available to assist us. Their friendly demeanor and willingness to go the extra mile enhanced our overall experience at Tower Suites.\n\nFurthermore, I had the privilege of witnessing a remarkable event during my stay—the Guinness World Record for padel tennis, set by none other than Mr. Tony Matharu himself. This extraordinary event added an exciting and memorable touch to my time at Tower Suites.\n\nWhile our overall experience at the hotel was positive, there was one aspect that left us perplexed and raised some concerns. We were instructed to vacate our rooms if we wanted them to be cleaned, citing it as a hotel policy. However, the reasoning behind this policy was not adequately explained, and it left us questioning its legitimacy.\n\nFortunately, we did not encounter any incidents of theft or misplaced belongings during our stay, which was a relief. Nevertheless, the requirement to leave our rooms during the cleaning process seemed questionable and lacking transparency. It would have been helpful to receive clearer information or alternative options for accommodating the cleaning while ensuring the security of our personal belongings.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Tower Suites by Blue Orchid was truly remarkable. The attentive and dedicated staff, led by Vi, Trevor, Boris, Mohammad, Yasen, Alex Diogo and Raj created an atmosphere that surpassed all expectations. The exceptional service, delectable cuisine, and memorable experiences made Tower Suites a top-notch choice for anyone seeking a professional and luxurious stay. I highly recommend Tower Suites for an unparalleled hospitality experience.\n\nThank you for reading:)",

Can have quite abit of noise at night if on the front, was on the 7th floor and could still hear traffic/people but not overtly bad\n\nMattress was too hard/uncomfortable for my liking but that’s personal preference\n\nGiven the price I wouldn’t stay again as it wasn’t for me but overall it’s a good hotel and would recommend.",

This I reported to receptionists in person.\n-----\nWhen you look room options in some hotels while booking, you might read: (1) room with sea view (2) room with garden view (3) room with city view.\n\nAt Blue Orchid suites there were no options like this. Instead there were suites with beautiful pictures overlooking Tower Bridge. It turned out to be so called a russian roulette you can get it or you can not.\n\nWhy not to divide suites by options at booking stage, like with view or without and do not make people hope or ask receptionist who were quite polite to say “no” everyday.\n\nThis was the main disappointment. Either you split options so people can pay more for view if they want to or pay less if they don’t care.\nOr do not put view picture on the suites option, rather on general pictures of hotel.\n\nAlso, of course, we stayed for 11 nights and it might be better for them for have 6-8-9-10 people changing nights in room with the view for reviews rather long time residents for only 1 review.\n\nWhen we came with kids little time before midnight, the bed for kids was not ready and we waited tired another half an hour for them to resolve the issue. To bring missing soap bar and slippers and yoga mat for morning. Quite disorganized when you arrive very late.\n\nWhen you have shower, water leaks along the mirror wall and it is all wet.\n\nTo bottom up: if you specifically choose this hotel for the view like us based on picture: it will be a roulette. You can get it or not. Might be disappointing. Do not reply on it. Pictures are misleading.\n\nGood things: convenient when with kids suites have fully packed kitchette with washing/drying mashing and capsules provided.\nWith small kids like ours - size of the room is ok to accommodate.\nLocation is close to must see and to the bank of the Thames.",

I wish they had rooms with 2 double or 2 queen beds for families so we would not have to book 2 rooms.

It was for my birthday and they provided a hand written card and chocolate covered strawberries. We had breakfast at the hotel most mornings and the selection was great. Our kids enjoyed the hot chocolate and pancakes/waffles for sure.\nIt would have been a 5 out of 5 if they were more helpful in fixing their mistake on our charge. Beware of how they charge your card if they simply take it to settle during check in as you may incur unnecessary conversion fees.\n1. The biggest issue is that they charged us using US currency when our card had no transaction fees. The staff took our card and never offered us an option to pay in local currency or US currency. We never once had any other vendors do this to us as many times as we've traveled internationally. I realized this when checking the credit card that the amount did not seem right (after using the conversion rate). They insisted that they charged using local currency and said it must be our credit card's issue. After talking to the credit card company and touching base with the staff again, one of their staff said they would pick whatever option. They never once offered to fix it for us so we are not out several hundred dollars due to their mistake. This was highly disappointing to us.\n2 As mentioned in several other reviews, the website advertised rooftop but you cannot use it unless for private event.",

However, if this is a known issue, why is there not signage telling people to keep the bathroom doors closed while showering?\n\nSecond, when checking out there was a long line and a huge crowd trying to check in a and out.  As we didn’t make any extra charges, we asked a staff member if we needed to wait in line or if we could just give him the room keys.  He said we needed to wait.  After we waited 30 minutes in line, the woman at the front desk said we hadn’t had to wait.  Very frustrating.",

Every single staff member where very polite and friendly. I booked this hotel for my girlfriends birthday, as soon as we arrived we was told that we have been upgraded to there best room. The room was immaculate. I can name so many big companies who  should stay at this hotel and learn about real customer service no joke. The Italian restaurant was amazing. We was given a tour of the rooftop bar and had photos taken this is something the waiters arranged for us when they released it was my girlfriends birthday and all of this was when they where getting ready to go home. Honestly cam not praise them enough",

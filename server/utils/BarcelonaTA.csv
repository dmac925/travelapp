Located in the heart of the Eixample district, between the exclusive Avinguda Diagonal and the famous Passeig de Gràcia, this hotel is known for its minimalist concept, modern setting and personalised service. Designed by architect Daniel Isern, the façade of this building is one of its highlights, featuring ceramic-based materials. It is also an ambitious and unique project, due to the robotics technique that used the music of Max Richter to create ceramic pieces that undoubtedly contribute to the extraordinary end product. The result is a boutique hotel with 94 rooms, all modern and bright, equipped with all sorts of creature comforts: 40-inch and 55-inch television, satellite channels, free high-speed Wi-Fi, dimmable lights, designer amenities, rain shower and 24 hour room service, among others. Ohla Eixample uses 21st century technology with different finishes and enamelling whose shape hides a line of lights that illuminate the façade at night with a finish reminiscent of paper. A magnificent combination of splendour and harmony that makes Ohla Eixample a meeting point for an unforgettable stay. The menu at Xerta Restaurant (1 Michelin start from November 16) is perfect for anyone looking to discover the culinary secrets of the Ebro region. Chef Fran López is in charge of the kitchen, representing the best version of this cuisine with products from the sea and the land perfectly selected to bring the truest flavours of the Delta to the city of Barcelona","info@ohlaeixample.com","5.0","This property is classified according to Giata.","10061941","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/21/5e/49/ec/exterior-view.jpg","41.394424","C/Corcega 289, 08008","es","Ohla Eixample","Barcelona, Catalonia","2.156406","Ohla Eixample","Carrer de Corsega, 313, 8008 Barcelona, Spain","0.11306002179789892","41.395694732666016","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l1","L1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Can Serra","2.1577770709991455","Can Serra","Rambla de Catalunya, 112, 8008 Barcelona, Spain","0.12743316391792","41.39464569091797","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l3","L3","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l5","L5","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Diagonal","2.158843994140625","Diagonal","Carrer de Balmes, 125, 8008 Barcelona, Spain","0.13964723144449692","41.39281463623047","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l6","L6","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l7","L7","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Provença","2.1580300331115723","Provenca","Via Augusta, 56, 8006 Barcelona, Spain","0.43388862792182115","41.39981460571289","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l6","L6","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l7","L7","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Gràcia","2.1521289348602295","Gracia","Carrer del Rossello, 151, 8036 Barcelona, Spain","0.486952455831968","41.38861846923828","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l5","L5","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Hospital Clínic","2.1510989665985107","Hospital Clinic","7230970","Eixample","15565885","La Dreta de l'Eixample",,,,,"831","94","true",,"355","$355","HotelsCom2","50","$50","$406","Hotels.com","true",,"355","$355","Expedia","50","$50","$406","Expedia.com","false",,"277","$277","FindHotel","32","$32","$310","Vio.com","false",,"319","$319","PreferredHotels1","31","$32","$351","Preferred Hotels","+34 937 37 79 77","574","$$$$","$264 - $438","548","13","#13 of 548 hotels in Barcelona","4.5","6","5","27","140","653","4.767707824707031","63","rooftop pool","33","junior suite","11","michelin star restaurant","31","recommend this hotel","14","bottle of cava","7","turn down service","21","excellent hotel","10","perfect stay","8","restaurants and bars","6","breakfast buffet is","10","visit barcelona","6","quiet street","12","reception staff","15","sagrada familia","8","mini bar","13","gothic quarter","11","las ramblas","66","city","36","metro","19","stylish","9","bathtub","12","spain","9","tickets","7","cruise",,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-10-15T03:49:22-04:00","921375235","5","921375235","Grab snacks if you like to graze not a lot of options in the hotel but very close to several Mercats by the hotel.","room_tip",,"2023-10-14T03:33:38-04:00","921222430","5","921222430","We really like staying in the Eixample  area, although many people prefer being in the hubbub of the old city.

Each space features cable television and a minimalist design with warm wooden furnishings. Outside, the Gothic Quarter has endless cafés, bars, boutiques, and historic landmarks to discover. From impressive basilicas to stunning theatres, like Gran Teatre del Liceu. See the best of Barcelona at DO Plaça Reial. This is a central location and prone to noise.

important role, creating an atmosphere of timeless luxury.

Inaugurated in February 2011, its location is perfect for tourism, shopping or business, with a fusion of calm serenity and the bustle of downtown Barcelona. The project has left untouched the building's historical facade from 1920 and other listed elements, including the main staircase, while giving the establishment a cutting-edge, minimalist interior design that combines various textures of black, white and oak wood. The building stands out for the sculpture on the facade by world-renowned artist, Frederic Amat. The hotel has 74 rooms, all equipped with a 40-inch TV screen and satellite channels, free Wi-Fi, telephone, safe box with room for a 17-inch laptop, adjustable lighting, individual thermostat, Egyptian cotton sheets, robe, slippers, kettle and minibar. Its culinary spaces are one of the highlights of the hotel, which locals consider great meeting points: Caelis restaurant, awarded with a Michelin star; La Plassohla, 'tapas' and small plates and Vistro 49, a boutique bar specialized in wines and cocktails. The terrace and the enclosed pool, the only one of its kind in Barcelona, have been called one of the best places to relax and enjoy a spectacular view of the city. Meeting rooms, gym, sauna and massage room, internet corner and parking garage are just some of the other services the department of Public Relations can offer to even further personalize each guest's stay and ensure it is an unforgettable experience. In short, a world of experiences that the whole Ohla Barcelona team offers guests looking for a hotel with charm and personality in the center of Barcelona.","info@ohlabarcelona.com","5.0","This property is classified according to Giata.","1940950","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/68/d5/18/exterior-view.jpg","41.387024",,"es","Hotel Ohla Barcelona","Barcelona, Catalonia","2.174289","Hotel Ohla Barcelona","Carrer de les Jonqueres, 17, 8003 Barcelona, Spain","0.13020455876556103","41.38884735107422","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l1","L1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l4","L4","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Urquinaona","2.173666000366211","Urquinaona","Placa de Catalunya, 8160 Barcelona, Spain","0.2474992673186721","41.387481689453125","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l1","L1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l3","L3","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l6","L6","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l7","L7","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","","Catalunya","2.1695590019226074","Catalunya","placa de l'Angel, 9999, 8002 Montserrat, Spain","0.30670630861813086","41.38385009765625","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l4","L4","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Jaume I","2.1784160137176514","Jaume I","La Rambla, 8002 Barcelona, Spain","0.39127229415125203","41.381446838378906","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l3","L3","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Liceu","2.1730289459228516","Liceu","Passeig de Gracia, 19, 8007 Barcelona, Spain","0.4184331998037444","41.390106201171875","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l2","L2","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l3","L3","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit","barcelona-barcelona-metro-l4","L4","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Barcelona Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_barcelona.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,"","Passeig de Gràcia","2.167351007461548","Passeig de Gracia","7230963","Barrio Gotico (Barri Gotic)","13191256","El Congres i els Indians","15565874","Ciutat Vella (Old Town)",,,"2524","74","true",,"365","$365","Expedia","51","$51","$416","Expedia.com","true",,"365","$365","HotelsCom2","51","$51","$416","Hotels.com","false",,"284","$285","FindHotel","33","$33","$318","Vio.com","false",,"328","$328","PreferredHotels1","32","$33","$361","Preferred Hotels","+34 937 37 79 77","1550","$$$$","$289 - $459","548","9","#9 of 548 hotels in Barcelona","4.5","25","34","137","473","1855","4.781015396118164","58","glass shower","136","junior suite","160","rooftop pool","135","gothic quarter","25","michelin star restaurant","32","concierge desk","34","tapas restaurant","59","bottle of cava","92","perfect location","25","turn down service","37","our honeymoon","67","walking distance","52","beautiful hotel","19","rooms are modern","21","breakfast was excellent","22","would highly recommend this hotel","18","el born","58","la rambla","29","sagrada familia","18","metro station","273","city","81","cathedral","43","privacy","90","ramblas","24","port","36","catalunya",,,,,,,,,"2023-10-15T03:52:47-04:00","921375741","5","921375741","Excellent and accommodating staff!

Close to the most important points of the city. Work of the architect Antoni de Moragas, consists of two buildings integrated in a garden. The centennial building was refurbished due to its historical value and it was the old residence of Dona Madronita, an intellectual of the born Catalan bourgeoisie at the end of XIX century.

The design of our hotel blends with relaxing music and stimulating scents to create a unique and sensual atmosphere. Located a few steps from the cathedral, it is the ideal place to discover Barcelona on foot. In addition, the hotel invites the client to enjoy the good weather and relax on the private rooftop terrace, Roba Estesa. Being the only Relais & Châteaux hotel in Barcelona and having been awarded as a hotel that adds value to the city's heritage, makes it even more special and unique. In Neri you can breathe the Gothic Quarter and savor the passage of time.
